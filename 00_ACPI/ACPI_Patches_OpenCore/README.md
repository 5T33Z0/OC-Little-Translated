# How OpenCore handles ACPI 

## Order of operations
Before you begin fiddling with SSDTs, it's a probably a good idea to take a look at how OpenCore handles ACPI tables and patches. In general, OpenCore applies ACPI changes globally to *every* operating system (unlike Clover) in the following order:

1. `Patch` is processed
2. `Delete` is processed
3. `Add` is processed
4. `Quirks` are processed

## ACPI patches integrated into OpenCore
OpenCore offers a few integrated patches ("Quirks") to address and fix specific ACPI tables (besides the `DSDT.aml`). They are located in the `ACIPI/Quirks` section of the `config.plist`:

Quirk               | Affected Table(s) | Table Description | What it fixes
--------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------
**FadtEnableReset** | **`FACP.aml`**    |Fixed ACPI Description Table (`FADT`). Defines various static system information related to configuration and power management.| Fixes reboot and shutdown issues. Can also fix the **Power Button**: if holding it  does not invoke the "Restart, Sleep, Cancel, Shutdown" menu, enable this quirk. If this doesn't fix it, try adding [**SSDT-PMC.aml**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/PMC_Support_(SSDT-PMC)). Fixes `Low Power S0 Idle` state. The **`FACP`** table characterizes the machine type and determines the power management method. If `Low Power S0 Idle` = `1`, it's an `AOAC` system. See the [**About AOAC**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/04_Fixing_Sleep_and_Wake_Issues/Fixing_AOAC_Machines) section for more details.
**NormalizeHeaders** | All Headers | Clear ACPI Header fields | Removes illegal characters from ACPI Headers. Only required for macOS 10.13.
**ResetLogoStatus**Â |**`BGRT.aml`** | Bootstrap graphics resource table | According to the ACPI specs, the `Displayed` item of the form should be `0`. However, some vendors have written non-zero data to the `Displayed` entry for some reason, which may cause the screen refresh to fail during the boot phase. The patch sets `Displayed` to `0`. **Note:** Not all machines have this table.
**RebaseRegions** | All Tables | Relocates ACPI Memory Regions | ACPI forms have memory regions with both dynamically allocated as well as fixed addresses. This quirk turns dynamically allocated addresses into fixed ones which can help with patched `DSDTs`.</br>:warning: **Caution**: This patch is very dangerous and should not be chosen unless relocating memory regions solves boot crashes!
**ResetHwSig** | **`FACS.aml`**| Sets Hardware Signature to `0` | `Hardware Signature` is part of the **`FACS`** table. It's calculated after the system has started based on the hardware configuration. If this value changes after the machine wakes up from a **Hibernate** state, the system will not recover correctly. **Note:** If the system has **Hibernation** disabled, you do not need to this quirk!
**SyncTableIds**| **`SLIC.aml`** | Microsoft Software Licensing table |Fixes `SLIC` table causing licensing issues in older Windows versions.
