# Utilizing AI to understand what an SSDT does

## ChatGPT and Hackintoshing
I recently discovered **ChatGPT**, which is

Just for fun and testing the algorithm, I threw Source Code of several SSDTs at it, to get its response. And it's mind-boggling what it can do. Below are the transcripts from my conversations with ChatGPT which proof that you can really use this AI in order to understand an .aml file. 

It may even be possible to use ChatGPT to assist you in writing your own ACPI tables by "cooperating" with it. This is a possibility I haven't explored yet but maybe you will?

### Example 1: Asking what `SSDT-HPET_RTC_TIMR_WNTF_WXPF` does

**ME**: "What does this SSDT do?" (Followed by the Source of the table)

**ChatGPT's Answer**: 
> This is an ACPI System Description Table (SSDT). It is a data structure that contains information about the hardware and configuration of a computer system. In this specific SSDT, there are several devices defined, including a High Precision Event Timer (HPE0), a Real-Time Clock (RTC0), and a System Timer (TIM0). Each of these devices has a hardware ID (_HID), a unique ID (_UID), and current resource settings (_CRS). The SSDT also includes several methods for each device, including a method to retrieve the device's status (_STA).
>
>The SSDT also includes several external references to other objects, such as SB.PCI0.LPC_.RTC_, SB.PCI0.LPC_.TIMR, WNTF, and WXPF. These objects are likely defined in other ACPI tables or in the system firmware.
>
>The SSDT also includes a scope block that defines two variables, XXXX and YYYY, and assigns them the values of the WNTF and WXPF objects, respectively. However, this assignment only occurs if the system is not running the Darwin operating system.
>
>Finally, the SSDT includes a method for each of the HPE0, RTC0, and TIM0 devices that returns a status of 0x0F if the system is running the Darwin operating system, or 0 if it is running any other operating system.

**ME**: "This SSDT is combined with binary renames which change WNTF to XXXX and WXPF to YYYYY in the DSDT so the original HPET device can be disabled and redefined."

**ChatGPT**: 
> Correct. It appears that this SSDT is intended to be used in conjunction with a Differentiated System Description Table (DSDT), which is another type of ACPI table that contains information about the system hardware and configuration. The DSDT may include references to the WNTF and WXPF objects, which are then replaced with references to XXXX and YYYY, respectively, when the SSDT is loaded.
>
>The purpose of this appears to be to disable the original High Precision Event Timer (HPET) device and redefine it with new resource settings and methods. This may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to fix a bug or issue with the original HPET device, or to customize its behavior for a specific system or operating system.

**ME**: "It's used to fix IRQ issues when running macOS on Wintel systems with an Ivy bridge cpu"

**ChatGPT**:
>Yes, it looks like this SSDT is intended to be used as a workaround for issues with the High Precision Event Timer (HPET) on systems running macOS on Intel CPUs with Ivy Bridge microarchitecture.
>
>On these systems, it is common for the HPET to cause conflicts with other devices that share the same IRQs (interrupt request lines), which can lead to various problems such as system instability or performance issues. The modifications made to the HPET in this SSDT are likely intended to address these issues by redefining the HPET with new resource settings that do not cause conflicts with other devices.
>
>It is worth noting that this SSDT is just one part of the solution for addressing IRQ conflicts on systems running macOS on Ivy Bridge CPUs. Other modifications to the system firmware may also be necessary in order to fully resolve these issues.

**ME**: "Fixing the IRQ issues is necessary to get audio working with the help of AppleALC.kext injected into macOS by a boot loader"

**ChatGPT**:
>Correct. It is common for systems running macOS on Intel CPUs with Ivy Bridge microarchitecture to experience issues with audio due to conflicts between the High Precision Event Timer (HPET) and other devices sharing the same IRQs. These conflicts can cause various problems such as system instability or performance issues.
>
>One way to address these issues is by using a boot loader to inject a kernel extension (kext) called AppleALC into the macOS operating system. AppleALC is a audio driver that can help to fix issues with audio on these systems by replacing the default audio driver with a customized version that is better suited to the hardware of the system.
>
>In order to fully resolve audio issues on systems running macOS on Ivy Bridge CPUs, it is often necessary to use a combination of techniques such as modifying the system firmware, injecting kexts, and making other changes to the system configuration. The specific steps needed to resolve audio issues will depend on the specific hardware and software configuration of the system.

### Example 2: Asking what `SSDT-PTSWAKTTS` does

**ME**: "What does this do?" (Followed by the Source Code from `SSDT-PTSWAKKTTS`)

**ChatGPT**:
>This is an ACPI System Description Table (SSDT) that defines several methods for controlling the power state of a computer system. The methods defined in this SSDT are:
>
>- Method (_PTS, 1): This method is used to put the system into a particular power state. It takes a single argument (Arg0) that specifies the desired power state. The method first checks whether the system is running the Darwin operating system, and if it is, it sets the value of the TPTS variable in the PCI9 device to the value of Arg0. It then checks the value of the FNOK variable in the PCI9 device, and if it is set to 1, it sets Arg0 to 3. The method then calls the _ON method of the DGPU device if it is available, and the EXT1 method if it is available. Finally, it calls the ZPTS method and the EXT2 method if they are available.
>- Method (_WAK, 1): This method is used to wake the system from a particular power state. It takes a single argument (Arg0) that specifies the power state to wake from. The method first checks whether the system is running the Darwin operating system, and if it is, it sets the value of the TWAK variable in the PCI9 device to the value of Arg0. It then checks the value of Arg0 and sets it to 3 if it is not between 1 and 5. The method then calls the _OFF method of the DGPU device if it is available, and the EXT3 method if it is available. It then calls the ZWAK method and stores the result in the Local0 variable. Finally, it calls the EXT4 method if it is available and returns the value of Local0.
>- Method (_TTS, 1): This method is used to transition the system to a particular power state. It takes a single argument (Arg0) that specifies the desired power state. The method first checks whether the system is running the Darwin operating system, and if it is, it calls the EXT5 method if it is available. The method then calls the ZTTS method if it is available, and finally calls the EXT6 method if it is available.
>
>This SSDT also includes several external references to other objects, such as ZPTS, ZWAK, ZTTS, EXT1, EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, EXT5, and EXT6. These objects are likely defined in other ACPI tables or in the system firmware. Additionally, the SSDT includes references to the DGPU._ON and DGPU._OFF methods, which are likely used to control the power state of a discrete graphics processing unit (GPU).

**ME**: "This ssdt is used to fix sleep and wake issues when running macos on Wintel systems"

**ChatGPT**:
>Yes, it appears that this SSDT is intended to be used as a workaround for issues with power management (sleep and wake) on systems running macOS on Intel CPUs. The methods defined in the SSDT, such as _PTS, _WAK, and _TTS, are part of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) standard and are used by the operating system to control the power state of the system.
>
>It is common for systems running macOS on Intel CPUs to experience issues with power management, such as problems with sleep and wake, due to differences between the hardware and firmware of these systems and the hardware and firmware of Apple's Mac systems. The modifications made in this SSDT are likely intended to address these issues by providing a customized version of the power management methods that is better suited to the hardware of the system.
>
>It is worth noting that this SSDT is just one part of the solution for addressing power management issues on systems running macOS on Intel CPUs. Other modifications to the system firmware or operating system may also be necessary in order to fully resolve these issues.
