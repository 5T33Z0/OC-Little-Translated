# Using unsupported Board-IDs with macOS 11.3 and newer
A set of Booter and Kernel patches lifted from OCLP which allow installing, booting and updating macOS Monterey on otherwise unsupported Board-IDs/CPUs.

## Use Cases
1. Installing, running and updating macOS Monterey and newer on systems with unsupported CPUs and their respective SMBIOS.
2. **Enabling System Updates**. As a side effect, you can use these patches to workaround issues with System Updates in macOS 12 and newer when using a SMBIOS of Mac models with a T1/T2 security chip, such as:

	- MacBookPro15,1 to 15,4
	- MacBookPro16,1 to 16,4
	- MacBookAir8,1/8,2
	- MacBookAir9,1
	- Macmini8,1
	- iMac20,1/20,2
	- iMacPro1,1
	- MacPro7,1

	:bulb: The problem occurs when using an SMBIOS of one of the Mac models listed above in combination with `SecureBootModel` set to `Disabled` as well as `SIP` disabled which is necessary if your iGPU/dGPU is no longer supported by macOS and you have to re-install removed graphics drivers. This is the case for Intel HD 4000 on-board graphics as well as NVIDIA Kepler cards which can be patched back in via OCLP and others (see Credits). Otherwise the system crashes on boot since re-installing of drivers to the system partition breaks the security seal of the volume. So in order to be able to boot the system ***and*** receive system updates, the Board-ID VMM spoof is the only workaround. You cannot apply these patches via Clover, btw!
	
## System Requirements
**Minimum macOS**: Big Sur 11.3 or newer (Darwin Kernel 20.4+)</br>
**CPU**: Basically, every outdated SMBIOS that supports your CPU but is no longer supported by macOS Monterey. This affects processors of the following Intel CPU families (newer ones don't need this since they are still supported):

- Sandy Bridge (need additional SurPlus patches)
- Ivy Bridge
- Haswell (partially)

Since this is a pretty new approach, I have to look into a bit more, but I am successfully using them on my [Lenovo T530 ThinkPad](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Lenovo-T530-Hackinosh-OpenCore). 

## How it works
**OpenCore Legacy Patcher** (OCLP) v0.3.2 introduced a set of new booter and kernel patches which make use of macOS'es virtualization capabilities (VMM) to trick macOS into "thinking" it is running in a Virtual Machine:

> Parrotgeek1's VMM patch set would force `kern.hv_vmm_present` to always return `True`. With hv_vmm_present returning True, both **`OSInstallerSetupInternal`** and **`SoftwareUpdateCore`** will set the **`VMM-x86_64`** board ID while the rest of the OS will continue with the original ID.
>
> - Patching kern.hv_vmm_present over manually setting the VMM CPUID allows for native features such as CPU and GPU power management
>
> **Source**: [OCLP issue 543](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/543)

This is great, because it allows using the "native", designated SMBIOS for a given CPU family, even if it is not officially supported by macOS 12 or newer. This not only improves CPU Power Management - especially on Laptops – it also allows installing, running and updating macOS Montereay and newer on otherwise unsupported hardware.

I had a look at the [**config.plist**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/blob/4a8f61a01da72b38a4b2250386cc4b497a31a839/payloads/Config/config.plist) included in OCLP, copied the relevant patches Booter and Kernel patches (and a few others) into my config and tested them. The attached plist contains the patches.

## Applying the Patches
:warning: Before applying the patches, make sure you have a working backup of your EFI folder stored on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive to boot your PC from just in case something goes wrong!

- [**Download**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/09_Board-ID_VMM-Spoof/BoardIDSkip+VMMPatch.plist.zip?raw=true) and unzip the attached .plist.
- Open it with a Plist Editor (e.g. ProperTree).
- Copy the Booter Patches over to your config.plist to the same section and enable them.
- Do the same for the Kernel Patches. The following need to be enabled:
	- Reroute kern.hv_vmm_present patch (1)
	- Reroute kern.hv_vmm_present patch (2)
	- Force IOGetVMMPresent
	- Enable additional Kernel patches if required (SurPlus patches for Sandy Bridge for example).
	- Optinally, add [**FeatureUnlock.kext**](https://github.com/acidanthera/FeatureUnlock) to enable [**Content Caching**](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchl9388ba1b/mac)
- Save the config and reboot.
- Verify that the the patches are working: enter `sysctl kern.hv_vmm_present` in Terminal. If it returns `1` the patch is working.

Enjoy macOS Monterey+ with the correct SMBIOS for your CPU and Updates!

## About the Patches

### Booter Patches
- **Patch 0**: Skips Hardware Board ID Check (enabled)
- **Patch 1**: Reroutes Hardware Board-ID check to OpenCore (enabled)

### Kernel Patches
In the .plist, only 3 of the 6 kernel patches are enabled by default. Enable additional one as needed. Here's what they do:

- **Patch 0**: disables [Library Validation Enforcement](https://www.naut.ca/blog/2020/11/13/forbidden-commands-to-liberate-macos/). (disabled)
- **Patches 1 and 2**: SurPlus patches for Race to condition Fix on Sandy Bridge and older. Fixes issues for macOS 11.3+, where Big Sur often wouldn't boot when using SMBIOS `MacPro5,1` (disabled). These patches are now Included in the `sample.plist` (OC 0.7.7+).
- **Patch 3 to 5**: Enable Board-ID spoof via VMM in macOS 12.0.1+ (enabled) &rarr; Allows booting, installing and updating macOS 12.x with unsupported Board-ID and SMBIOS

**NOTE**: RDRAND Patches for Sandy Bridge CPUs are no longer required since OpenCore 0.7.8 and must be disabled/deleted.

## Testing
I tested these patches on my Lenovo T530 Notebook, using an Ivy Bridge CPU with `MacBookPro10,1` SMBIOS, which is officially not compatible with macOS Monterey. After rebooting, the system started without using `-no_compat_check` boot-arg, as you can see here:

Terminal shows the currently used Board-ID which belongs to the `MacBookPro10,1` SMBIOS as you can see in Clover Configurator. Usually, running macOS would require using `MacBookPro11,4` which uses a different Board-ID as you can see in the Clover Configurator snippet:

Next, I checked for updates and was offered macOS 12.1 beta:

Installation went smoothly and macOS 12.1 booted without issues:
