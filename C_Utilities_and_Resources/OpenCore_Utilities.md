# OpenCore Utilities
The OpenCore package contains lot of additional utilities to set-up, configure and troubleshoot your system. Unfortunately, the `Documentation.pdf` does not include a seperate chapter for these utilities. Below you find a table with the included utilities and what they are for.

Utility | Description
-------:|------------
**acdtinfo** | Lists Kexts by Acidanthera and if they are installed or not.
**ACPIe** | For debugging ACPI tables (cf. Chpt. 4.5: "Patch Properties").
**CreateVault** | For creating a secure vault (cf. Chpt. 8.5: "Security Properties").
**disklabel** | Tool for changing the disk label displayed in BootPicker (cf. Chpts. 8.3 and 11.4).
**FindSerialPort** | Script to find PCIe serial ports and their paths.
**icnspack** |Tool for generating `.icns` files for items displayed in BootPicker (cf. Chpt. 11.4: "OpenCanopy").
