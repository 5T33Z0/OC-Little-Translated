# Switching from official OpenCore to OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build

## About
**OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build** is an unofficial fork of OpenCore by [btwise](https://gitee.com/btwise/OpenCore_NO_ACPI), not endorsed by Acidanthera, the dev team behind OpenCore. The main and only difference between this and the official OpenCore version is that it allows to NOT inject ACPI Tables and boot parameters into other OSes besides macOS like the official release does.

It is useful in cases where injecting ACPI tables and settings might cause issues in other Operating Systems such as Microsoft Windows, where injecting non-ACPI conform SSDTs are the #1 reason for the dreaded "Blue Screen of Death". So basically, this build of OpenCore is for n00b users (and so-called Hackintosh "veterans") who don't know how to add 3 lines of code to SSDTs to disable code injection into Windows (we know who you are).

So, how does it work? It has one more Quirk added to `ACPI/Quirks` and the `Booter/Quirks` Section called `EnableForAll`. And if it is set to `false`, no SSDTs and Booter parameters will be injected into other OSes besides macOS.

## Prerequisites
1. An already working EFI folder and config.plist
2. :warning: Ensure that your OpenCore build and the OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build you want to switch to are on the same version! Otherwise you will get validation errors. In other words: if your OpenCore build is on 0.8.7, OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build needs to be on 0.8.7 as well!

## Instructions
1. :warning: Backup your current EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive!
2. Download the appropriate build [**OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build**](https://github.com/wjz304/OpenCore_NO_ACPI_Build/releases) matching your OpenCore version and unzip it
3. Replace the following files in your `EFI` Folder:
	- **BootX64.efi** (in EFI/Boot)
	- **OpenCore.efi** (in EFI/OC)
	- Any **Drivers** you use (in EFI/OC/Drivers)
	- Any **Tools** you use (in EFI/OC/Tools)
4. Add the following Keys to your `config.plist`:
	- Under `ACPI/Quirks`, add: `EnableForAll` (Type: Boolean) and set it to `NO`
	- Under `Booter/Quirks`, add: `EnableForAll` (Type: Boolean) and set it to `NO`
5. Save and reboot.

## Verifying
- Boot Windows from the OpenCore BootPicker
- Run HWiNFO
- In the main window, check the "Computer Brand Name". It should be a combination of manufacturer and mainboard (or Laptop) model. If it says "Acidanthera" followed by the mac Model set in SMBIOS instead, then you've done something wrong.

**NOTE**
If you just want to prohibit SMBIOS injection into Windows, you can achieve this with the regular OpenCore build as well. You just have change the following settings in your config.plist:

- `Kernel/Quirks/CustomSMBIOSGuid` = `YES`
- `PlatformInfo/SMBIOS/UpdateSMBIOSMode` = `Custom`
