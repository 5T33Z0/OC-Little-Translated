# Fixing the battery status indicator on Laptops
Before applying any of these battery patches available here, you should test the new [**ECEnabler.kext**](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) first, which "allows reading Embedded Controller fields over 1 byte long, vastly reducing the amount of ACPI modification needed (if any) for working battery status". It works on a lot of ThinkPads without additional renames and Battery SSDTs.

## Battery Hotfixes included
This project includes some of the OpenCore battery hotfixes for Notebooks (such as ThinkPads). For more battery hotfixes, refer to [GZXiaoBai's Github Repo](https://github.com/GZXiaoBai/Hackintosh-Battery-Hotpatch) (written in Chinese unfortunately).

## Battery Hotfix Tutorials
Below you'll find some links to battery patching guides. If you want to understand and learn how to make your own battery hotfix, you can go to XStarDev's tutorial site and ask questions on the `Issues` page (please don't ask too low-level questions, otherwise it will be considered as invalid).
