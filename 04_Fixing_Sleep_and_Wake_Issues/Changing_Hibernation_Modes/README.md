## About  

Hibernation on macOS is designed to save system state to disk, allowing the machine to power off completely while preserving open applications and data. However, on Hackintoshes, getting hibernation to work reliably can be challenging due to differences in hardware, firmware, and power management implementations.

By default, macOS expects Apple hardware with native power management, including properly implemented **RTC memory**, **NVRAM storage**, and **device wake signals**. When these features are missing or misconfigured on a Hackintosh, issues like **black screens on wake, failed restores, or system crashes** can occur.  

This guide covers essential adjustments to enable stable hibernation on Hackintoshes, including:  

- Configuring **HibernateMode** correctly  
- Ensuring storage devices are recognized as **internal**  
- Blocking problematic **RTC memory writes**  
- Redirecting hibernation data to **NVRAM**  
- Applying required **kexts and patches**  

By following these steps, you can achieve a functional hibernation setup, allowing your Hackintosh to resume from sleep seamlessly‚Äîjust like a real Mac.

## Understanding Power States

PC Power States (S-States) define different levels of system power consumption and functionality. These states range from `S0` (fully operational) to `S5` (soft-off), providing various levels of power saving and system responsiveness.

| State | Name | Description | Power Consumption | System Functionality |
|:-----:|------|-------------|:-----------------:|----------------------|
| `S0` | Working State | Fully operational system | Highest | Full CPU and hardware operation |
| `S1` | Standby | Minimal power saving | Very Low | Context preserved, quick resume |
| `S2` | Standby | More power saving | Low | Processor stopped, context saved |
| `S3` | Sleep | Suspend to RAM | Minimal | Most components powered down |
| `S4` | Hibernate | Suspend to Disk | Near Zero | System state saved to hard drive |
| `S5` | Soft Off | Complete shutdown | Zero | No system state maintained |

**Key characteristics**:

- Lower S-States provide increased power savings
- Higher states progressively reduce power consumption
- Each state involves different levels of system context preservation
- Transition between states managed by operating system and ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)

## Hibernation modes in macOS

macOS (Lion and newer) supports three different modes of hibernation: `hibernatemode 0`, `hibernatemode 3` and `hibernatemode 25`. The differences betweeen these modes are as follows:

| **Mode** | **`hibernatemode 0`** <br>(Standard Sleep) | **`hibernatemode 3`** <br>(Safe Sleep) | **`hibernatemode 25`** <br> (Deep Hibernation)
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| **RAM Powered?**   | ‚úÖ Yes, stays powered | ‚úÖ Yes, stays powered | ‚ùå No, completely powered off |
| **Writes to Disk?** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes, saves RAM contents to <br>`/var/vm/sleepimage` | ‚úÖ Yes, saves RAM contents to <br>`/var/vm/sleepimage` |
| **Power Consumption** | üîã **Higher** (RAM stays active) | üîã **Lower** (RAM powered, but backup exists) | üì¥ **Zero** (RAM completely off) |
| **Wake-up Speed** | ‚ö° **Instant** | ‚ö° **Fast** (RAM is active) | üêå **Slow** (RAM must be restored from disk) |
| **Used on** | :desktop_computer: Desktops (iMac, Mac Pro) | :computer: MacBooks (default) | :computer: MacBooks with **very low** Battery, conneted to AC power|
| **When Activated?** | Standard **sleep mode** &rarr; **No data saved to disk** | Normal sleep mode &rarr; **Backs up RAM** but keeps it powered | System writes RAM to disk &rarr; **RAM is fully powered off** |
| **Risk of Data Loss?** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Yes, if power is lost** | ‚ùå **No, backup exists** | ‚ùå **No, full restore possible** |

### Mode Explanations
1. **`hibernatemode 0` (Standard Sleep ‚Äì No Hibernation)**
   - RAM stays powered.
   - Nothing is written to disk.
   - **Fastest wake-up**, but if power is lost, all unsaved data is gone.
   - **Used by desktop Macs** like iMacs and Mac Pros.

2. **`hibernatemode 3` (Safe Sleep ‚Äì Default for MacBooks)**
   - RAM stays powered, **but** the system also **backs up RAM contents to disk**.
   - Allows **quick wake-ups**, and if the battery dies, macOS can **restore from disk**.
   - **Used on MacBooks** to balance speed and safety.

3. **`hibernatemode 25` (True Hibernation ‚Äì No Power Use)**
   - RAM contents are **written to disk, and RAM is completely powered off**.
   - Uses **zero battery**, similar to **Windows hibernation**.
   - Wake-up is **slow**, since RAM must be restored from disk.
   - Used when **battery is critically low**.

## Prerequisites for enabling Hibernation on Hackintosh systems

For hibernation to work successfully on Hackintoshes, there are a few prerequisites that *must* be met first:

### Config Adjustments

- **Storage Detection:**  
  Ensure that your storage is recognized as `internal`. Check this in **System Profiler** or **Hackintool** (`System/Peripherals`). If the SSD/NVMe appears as an external drive, retrieve the **PCI device path** of the **SATA/NVMe controller** from Hackintool. Then, edit `config.plist` and add the **DeviceProperty** `built-in` with a **Data** value of `01000000`. Save the config, reboot, and verify again.  

- **Fix Black Screen on Wake (Intel Laptops):**  
  Some Intel laptops require a patch to fix black screen issues after waking from hibernation. This patch can be found in `sample.plist` (included with OpenCore) under **`UEFI/ReservedMemory`** (e.g., *"Fix black screen on wake from hibernation for Lenovo ThinkPad T490"*).  

- **Blocking RTC Writes:**  
  Prevent write operations to RTC memory regions `0x80`-`0xAB` (and possibly `0xB0`-`0xB4`). For details, refer to [**RTCMemoryFixup**](https://github.com/acidanthera/RTCMemoryFixup).  

  - Blocking these RTC writes prevents hibernation data from being stored in RTC. Instead, OpenCore should read hibernation data from **NVRAM** (`Misc/Boot/HibernateMode` = `Auto` or `NVRAM`).  
  - This requires **HibernationFixup.kext**, ensuring that hibernation data is correctly redirected to NVRAM.  

- **Skip Boot Picker on Wake:**  
  Set **`Misc/Boot/HibernationSkipsPicker`** to `true` in `config.plist`. This prevents booting into another OS after waking from hibernation, which could disrupt the hibernated system state.  
  - **Important:** Avoid making BIOS/UEFI changes while the system is in hibernation, as this can cause unpredictable issues.  

### Required Kexts

- **[HibernationFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup)**  
  - Required if `HibernateMode` is set to anything other than `0`.  

- **[RTCMemoryFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/RTCMemoryFixup)**  
  - Needed to block RTC memory writes.  
  - If your system crashes when restoring from hibernation, this kext and additional RTC memory region fixes are required.  

## Changing the hibernation mode

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> Don't fiddle around with these settings unless you know what you are doing!

Open Terminal. Enter `man pmset` &rarr; Lists all available `pmset` parameters to modify System Power Management!

To check the currently selected Hibernation mode, enter:

```bash
pmset -g | grep hibernatemode
```

### hibernatemode 0: Suspend to RAM only
Default for desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep. 

To enable hibernatemode 0, enter in Terminal:

```bash
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
```

If you have issues with sleep, run the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
sudo pmset hibernatemode 0
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo touch /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo chflags uchg /var/vm/sleepimage
```

This will delete the sleepimage and create a new, write-protected one.

### hibernatemode 3: Suspend to disk and RAM
Default on portables. Hibernation mode 3 will transition from `S3` to `S4` depending on the timeout and battery thresholds set in `pmset` (mor on this laster).  The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image.

Benefit of this mode is that is does quicken the wakeup time when the device is being used quickly while still providing the benefits of hibernation when the device is not in use overnight. 

To enable hibernatemode 3, enter in Terminal:

```bash
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3
```

This mode (as well as hibernatemode 25) does require [**HibernationFixup**](https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup) kext to work ‚Äì otherwise the device stays in `S3` and never transitions to `S4`. You do also need to set a value to boot-arg `hbfx-ahbm=`, representing the parameters/features of HibernationFixup. For example `hbfx-ahbm=55`, which contains the following 4 settings:

- `EnableAutoHibernation` (1)
- `WhenLidIsClosed` (2)
- `WhenExternalPowerIsDisconnected` (4)
- `WhenBatteryIsAtWarnLevel` (16)
- `WhenBatteryAtCriticalLevel` (32)

For more settings, please refer to the boot-args settings of the [**HibernationFixup**](https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup) repo!

### hibernatemode 25: Suspend to disk and RAM (reduced power consumption)
For portables as well. Mode 25 is only settable via `pmset`. Same as mode 3, but will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting. Hibernatemode 25 will always go directly from `S0` to `S4`.

When using this mode, entering the hibernation state takes a bit longer than using mode 0. Please note that the hibernate file may only point to a file located on the root volume.

To enable it, enter in Terminal:

```bash
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25
```

- `WhenBatteryAtCriticalLevel` (32)

For more settings, please refer to the boot-args section of the [**HibernationFixup**](https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup) repo!

### Which Mode Should You Use?
- **MacBook users** ‚Üí Stick with **hibernatemode 3** (default).
- **Hackintosh laptops** ‚Üí **hibernatemode 3** (fast wake-ups) or **hibernatemode 25** (true hibernation).
- **Hackintosh desktops** ‚Üí **hibernatemode 0** (fast sleep) or **hibernatemode 25** (power-saving).
- **Long-term sleep?** ‚Üí Use **hibernatemode 25** to **save power**.

## Configuring Hibernation

Picking a hibernation mode is only the first step. In order for hibernation to work properly, it must be configured as well by applying standby arguments via `pmset` in Terminal or Hackintool.

The configuration primarily involves setting timers that control state transitions ‚Äì for example, how long the system should remain in sleep (`S3`) before transitioning to hibernation (`S4`). On battery-powered devices, the system also takes the current battery level into account when determining these transitions, represented by the parameters `standbydelayhigh`, `standbydelaylow`, `highstandbythreshold`.

**The following parameters have to be set**:

Argument | Description 
---------:|-------------
`sleep` | System sleep timer (value in minutes, or `0` to disable). Time in minutes before the system enters sleep mode (not hibernation). This is the initial entry into `S3` state that triggers hibernation after all the delay timers have counted down.
`standby` | Causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. The setting standby will be visible in `pmset -g` if the feature is supported on this machine. Default: `ON` for supported hardware. 
`standbydelayhigh` | Time in seconds before hibernation when battery is *above* the `highstandbythreshold`.
`standbydelaylow` | Time in seconds before hibernation when battery is *below* the `highstandbythreshold`.
`highstandbythreshold` | Battery percentage threshold (default 50%) that determines whether to use the *high* or *low* delay. 
`autopoweroff` | European Energy directive feature that enables deeper sleep state after specified delay. Default: ON. After sleeping for `<autopoweroffdelay>` amount of seconds, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep. Only available when the system is connected to AC power. 
`autopoweroffdelay` | Delay in seconds before the system enters `autopoweroff` mode.

### About `autopoweroff`
The autopoweroff state is distinct from standard S4 hibernation - while both write a hibernation image, autopoweroff maintains certain chipset functions in a low-power state instead of powering off completely. This results in wake times that are slower than `S3` sleep but faster than full `S4` hibernation. It seems to be a hybrid state **optimized specifically for EU energy regulations** - using the safety of having a hibernation image but keeping critical chipset components in a deep sleep rather than fully powered down. The autopoweroff feature in macOS is designed to work ***only when the system is connected to AC power***!

**How autopoweroff Works**:

- **Purpose**: The feature is meant to save energy by powering down the system more deeply after an extended period of standby.
- **Condition**: Since autopoweroff involves fully powering off certain components (and possibly the entire system), it only activates when the system is on AC power. **This ensures the system can reliably resume without risking data loss or hardware issues caused by insufficient battery charge.**

**Behavior on Battery**:

- When running on battery, macOS relies on *standby* and *standbydelay* to manage power consumption. These modes keep the system in a low-power state but avoid deeper shutdowns like autopoweroff.

**Why It Doesn't Work on Battery**:

- Resuming from autopoweroff requires a reboot-like process, which consumes more power than resuming from sleep or standby. 
- macOS prioritizes preserving battery life and maintaining faster wake times when on battery.

I have two Lenovo Thinkpads, but autopoweroff is only available on the older one. I don't know exactly if this depends on the region the laptop was manufactured for or if the availability of autopoweroff is based on the used SMBIOS.

### Understanding Power State Transitions and Timers
The system uses four distinct timers to manage power state transitions:

- The initial `sleep` timer that triggers entry into `S3` sleep
- `standbydelayhigh` for hibernation when battery is above the threshold
- `standbydelaylow` for hibernation when battery is below the threshold
- `autopoweroffdelay` for entering the special chipset sleep state

**These timers create two possible power transition paths**:

1. **"Standard" hibernation path**:
   - S0 (awake) ‚Üí S3 (sleep) ‚Üí [standbydelay based on battery] ‚Üí S4 (hibernation)

2. **"Autopoweroff" path**:
   - S0 (awake) ‚Üí S3 (sleep) ‚Üí [autopoweroffdelay] ‚Üí writes hibernation image ‚Üí chipset sleep state

Here's a visualization of how these timers working:

![hibernate-timeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/568a0716-ae1a-42c4-9b82-10e357d310f7)

**Explanation**:

1. **Active**:
   - The system is fully operational, with no power-saving features active (S0 state).

2. **Sleep**:
   - The system enters a low-power state, keeping the contents of RAM active for quick wake-up.
   - This is typical for `hibernatemode = 3` (default for most Macs), where:
     - RAM stays powered.
     - The `sleepimage` is also written to disk as a backup.

3. **Hibernate**:
   - For `hibernatemode = 25`, the system powers off RAM and writes the contents entirely to the `sleepimage` file on disk.
   - This is a full hibernation mode, ideal for saving battery but slower to wake up.

4. **Standby and Autopoweroff**:
   - These states are additional layers of power management:
     - **Standby (`standby = 1`)**: After a specified delay (`standbydelay`), the system transitions from sleep to a hibernation-like state to save more power.
     - **Autopoweroff (`autopoweroff = 1`)**: After a ***further*** delay (`autopoweroffdelay`), the system can power down more deeply, saving even more energy.

### Getting the currently set parameters

- First, you have to check the current pm settings. To do so, you can enter `pmset -g` in Terminal (or use Hackintool). This example is from my Lenovo T530:<br>![pmsetg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72042d91-41bd-4d37-ad6a-c66b55e92cd3)
- As you can see, the `autopoweroffdelay` is set to the ridiculously high value of 259200 seconds, which equals to 72 hours (or 3 days) before entering the `autopoweroff` state.
- `standby` is enabled, which is good
- `sleep` is enabled and set to 10 minutes. That's the time before the system enters `S3` state.
- The sleepimage (`hibernatefile`)is present
- `stanbydelaylow` and `standbydelayhigh` are booth set to 4200 seconds (= 70 minutes)

###  Testing Hibernation

1. In order for hibernation modes 3 or 25 to work, we have to ensure that the sleepimage is *not* write-protected. Deleting and creating a new, write-protected 0 byte sleepimage is the usual procedure when using hibernatemode 0. This is what happens if you click the screwdriver icon in Hackintool ("Power" Tab). But we *don't* want that. So open Terminal and enter: 
    
    ```bash
    ls -lO /private/var/vm/sleepimage
    ```
    
    The default output should be: 
    
    ```bash
    -rw------  1 root  wheel  <size> <date> /private/var/vm/sleepimage
    ```
  
    If the file is write-read-only, you can use the following commands to restore the default value:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 600 /private/var/vm/sleepimage
    sudo chown root:wheel /private/var/vm/sleepimage
    ```
2. Next, you need to set short timer values to test hibernation:

    ```bash
    sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25        # or hibernatemode 3, depending on which mode you want to test
    sudo pmset -a standby 1
    sudo pmset -a standbydelaylow 60      # 1 minute before entering standby on low battery
    sudo pmset -a standbydelayhigh 120    # 2 minutes before entering standby on AC power
    sudo pmset -a powernap 0
    sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 1
    sudo pmset -a autopoweroffdelay 300   # 5 minutes before full shutdown (if supported)
    sudo pmset -a disksleep 10
    sudo pmset -a sleep 1
    sudo pmset -a displaysleep 2
    ```
3. Reboot the system, login and just leave the system at idle until it enters sleep. If your system is a laptop, supports autopoweroff and is connected to AC, it should enter autopoweroff after 5 minutes ‚Äì indicated by the sleep indicator (pulsing light) should stop. 

4. To resume from autopoweroff, press the power button. The system should resume to the login screen but it will take longer since it restores from the hibernation image from disk. It will feel similar to booting the system ‚Äì just without a bootmenu.

5. Once hibernation is working as expected, change the timer values above to more reasonable values that make sense for your system/working habits.
