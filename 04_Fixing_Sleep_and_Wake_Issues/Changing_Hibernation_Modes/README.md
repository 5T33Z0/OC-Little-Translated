## Instructions

Open Terminal. Enter `man pmset` &rarr; Lists all available `pmset` parameters to modify System Power Management!

:warning: **CAUTION**: Don't fiddle around with these settings unless you know what you are doing!

## Changing Hibernation modes

To check the currently selected Hibernation mode, enter:

```
pmset -g | grep hibernatemode
```

### hibernatemode 0: Suspend to RAM only
Default for desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep. To enable it, enter in Terminal:

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
```

### hibernatemode 3: Suspend to disk and RAM
Default on portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from hibernate image. To enable it, enter in Terminal:

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3
```

### hibernatemode 25: Suspend to disk and RAM (reduced power consumption)
For portables as well. Mode 25 is only settable via `pmset`. Same as mode 3, but will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting. When using this mode, entering the hibernation state takes a bit longer than using mode 0 using this mode. To enable it, enter in Terminal:

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 25
```
Please note that hibernatefile may only point to a file located on the root volume.

## More `pmset` parameters

Listed below are power managements settings you can configure in Terminal via **`pmset`**

 Setting       | Description | Value |
---------------|-------------|:-------:|
`displaysleep`| Display sleep timer; replaces `dim` argument in 10.4.| Minutes, or 0 to disable 
`disksleep`   | Disk spindown timer; replaces `spindown` argument in 10.4.| Minutes, or `0` to disable 
`sleep`       | System sleep timer.| Minutes, or `0` to disable 
`womp`        | Wake on Ethernet magic packet. Same as "Wake for network access" in the Energy Saver preferences. | `0`/`1`
`ring`| Wake on modem ring.| `0`/`1`
`powernap`   | Enable/disable Power Nap on supported machines.| `0`/`1`
`proximitywake`          | Controls system wake from sleep based on proximity of devices using the same iCloud ID on supported systems.| `0`/`1`
`autorestart`| Automatic restart on power loss.| `0`/`1`
`lidwake`| Wake the machine when the laptop lid (or clamshell) is opened.| `0`/`1`
`acwake`| Wake the machine when power source (AC/battery) is changed.| `0`/`1`
`lessbright`| Slightly turn down display brightness when switching to this power source.| `0`/`1`
`halfdim`| Display sleep will use an intermediate half-brightness state between full brightness and fully off.| `0`/`1`
`sms` | Use Sudden Motion Sensor to park disk heads on sudden changes in G force.| `0`/`1`
`hibernatemode`| Change hibernation mode. Use with caution. | Integer 
`hibernatefile`| Change hibernation image file location. Image may only be located on the root volume. Please use with caution.| Path
`ttyskeepawake` | Prevent idle system sleep when any tty (e.g., remote login session) is active. A tty is inactive only when its idle time exceeds the system sleep timer.| `0`/`1`
`networkoversleep` | Affects how OS X networking presents shared network services during system sleep. Not used by all platforms; changing its value is unsupported. | Unsupported 
`destroyfvkeyonstandby`  | Destroy File Vault Key when going to standby mode. If the keys are destroyed, the user will be prompted to enter the password while coming out of standby mode. | `1` - Destroy, <br> `0` - Retain

## Notes and further Resources
- If you feel uncomfortable using Terminal, you can also use Hackintool to check and change the `hibernatemode`. Simply click on the "Power" Tab and there you find all the currently set parameters.
