## ABOUT
Compendium of Guides, ACPI Hotpatches and Binary Renames for use with the OpenCore Boot Manager based on [**OC-Little by Daliansky**](https://github.com/daliansky/OC-little) translated from Chinese. All Binary Renames, ACPI Hotpatches (using `OCLT` as OEMID) remain untouched except where indicated.

This repo provides additional ACPI hotpatches and guides complementary to the ones provided by the OpenCore Package and Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide. It covers all angles of modern hackintoshing. From adding and enabling devices and features, fixing USB and Sleep issues, laptop-specific fixes, GPU optimizations and more (check the TOC for details). Although aimed primarily at OpenCore users, all of the SSDTs and most of the guides/techniques are applicable to Clover as well.

### DISCLAIMER
The methods and techniques presented in this repo are based on utilizing the official OpenCore release and its features alongside Kexts, SSDTs, Device Properties and other tools to enable/disable devices and features in macOS to get a *proper* working system which is ACPI conform!

**OC-Little Translated** does not consider patching the `DSDT` an *appropriate* measure to get the "Real Vanilla Hackintosh" experience. In fact, it's quite the opposite, as explained [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20220807100310/https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/352881-when-is-rebaseregions-necessary/):

> MaLd0n's implications that you need a custom DSDT to add and remove (well, remove yes, but disabling is good enough in virtually all cases) devices is **incorrect**. Aside from those claims, most device rename changes (probably also things you considered „missing“) are also not needed, as they are performed by Lilu and its plug-ins. This approach is a lot safer than previous ACPI renames as dumb find-replace patches can yield false positives, the kext approach cannot. 

Therefore, **OC-Little Translated does not support nor promote patching DSDTs** (and the shady business practices behind it), as well as pre-patched ISOs and unofficial modified forks of OpenCore that prevent injecting ACPI tables into Windows, just because the guy running his "Real Vanilla Hackintosh" forum doesn't know how to write proper ACPI tables that don't cause a Blue Screen of Death!

## About the translation

- AI-based translation using deepL, google translator as well as manual copyediting.
- Restructured the repository into more plausible (sub-)sections and categories based on types of issues, components, methods, etc.
- Restructured Texts for better readability and comprehensibility
- Rewrote whole sections which were confusing/misleading (`ACPI` and `USB Port Mapping` for example)
- Added missing descriptions
- Added further explanations where necessary
- Added new content (added USB Port Mapping via ACPI to Chapter 3, Chapters 7 to 11 as well as the whole "Appendix" section)

**NOTE**: Due to the fact that I don't speak Chinese the translation might not be 100% accurate.
