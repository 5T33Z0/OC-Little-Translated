## About this Translation:

- AI-based translation using deepL, google translator as well as manual copyediting.
- Restructured the repository into more plausible (sub-)sections and categories based on types of issues, components, methods, etc.
- Restructured Texts for better readability and comprehensibility
- Rewrote whole sections which were confusing/misleading (`ACPI` and `USB Port Mapping` for example)
- Added missing descriptions
- Added further explanations where necessary
- Added new content (Added USB Port Mapping via ACPI to Chapter 3, added Chapters 7 to 10 and the Appendix)

**NOTE**: Due to the fact that I don't speak chinese some of the translation might not be 100% accurate.
