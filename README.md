## DISCLAIMER
1. OC-Little Translated is not an installation guide for getting your system up and running with macOS – use Dortania's excellent [**OpenCore Install Guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for that! Instead, it's a supplementary resource that offers guides and fixes for various issues related to hackintosh systems, along with explanations and context about how they work. It is regularly updated to reflect the latest discoveries and developments of the hackintosh community.
2. The material presented in this repo is designed to empower users to create a *proper* working system running macOS without breaking ACPI-compliancy! Therefore, **OC-Little Translated** does not support methods which do not hold up to this premise – such as patching the `DSDT` – since it's not an *appropriate* measure to get the "Real Vanilla Hackintosh" experience. In fact, it's quite the opposite, [**as discussed here**](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/352881-when-is-rebaseregions-necessary/#comment-2790870).
	
## ABOUT
Collection of guides, ACPI Hotpatches and Binary Renames for use with the OpenCore Boot Manager based on [**OC-Little by Daliansky**](https://github.com/daliansky/OC-little) translated from Chinese.

Besides the original translated guides, this repo contains additional guides complementary to the ones provided by the OpenCore Package and Dortania's OpenCore Guides. It covers a wide range of hackintosh-related topics, including: 

- ACPI basics
- Enabling devices and features
- Fixing sleep/wake and other power-related issues
- Guides for Mapping USB Ports
- Fixing Laptop-specific issues
- Fixing graphics-related issues and tweaks
- Config-related tips
- Guides for using OpenCore Legacy Patcher on Wintel Systems

Check the table of contents for more. Although aimed primarily at OpenCore users, all of the SSDTs and most of the guides/techniques are applicable to Clover as well.

### About the translation
- AI-based translation using deepL, google translator as well as manual copyediting.
- Restructured the repository into more plausible (sub-)sections and categories based on types of issues, components, methods, etc.
- Restructured Texts for better readability and comprehensibility
- Rewrote whole sections which were confusing/misleading (`ACPI` and `USB Port Mapping` for example)
- Added missing descriptions
- Added further explanations where necessary
- Added new content (USB Port Mapping via ACPI, Chapters 7 to 14 as well as the whole "Appendix" section)

> **Note**: Due to the fact that I don't speak Chinese the translation might not be 100% accurate.
