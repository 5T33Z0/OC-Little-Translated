	```

	```

## Check Disk Usage (optional)
- Run [**Grand Perspective**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/grandperspectiv/) (or [**SquirrelDisk**](https://www.squirreldisk.com/)) to visualize disk storage usage.
- Check for leftover files related to Ollama and Docker (should be large blocks with several gigabytes of storage) and delete them.
