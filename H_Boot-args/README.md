# Boot arguments explained
Listed below you find an incomplete list of commonly used as well as rather uncommon boot-args which can be injected by OpenCore and Clover.

### Debugging
|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`-v`**|_V_erbose Mode. Replaces the progress bar with a terminal output with a bootlog which helps resolving issues. Combine with `debug=0x100` and `keepsyms=1`
**`-f`**|_F_orce-rebuild kext cache on boot.
**`-s`**|_S_ingle User Mode. This mode will start the terminal mode, which can be used to repair your system. Should be disabled with a Quirk since you can use it to bypass the Admin account password.
**`-x`**|Safe Mode. Boots macOS with a minimal set of system extensions and features. It can also check your startup disk to find and fix errors like running First Aid in Disk Utility. Can be triggered from OC bootmenu by holding a key combination if `PollAppleHotkeys` is enabled.
**`debug=0x100`**|Disables macOS'es watchdog. Prevents the machine from restarting on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues.
**`keepsyms=1`**|Companion setting to `debug=0x100` that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself.
**`dart=0`**|Disables VT-x/VT-d. Nowadays, `DisableIOMapper` Quirk is used instead.
**`cpus=1`**|Limits the number of CPU cores to 1. Helpful in cases where macOS won't boot or install otherwise.
**`npci=0x2000`**/**`npci=0x3000`**|Disables PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`. Alternatively, use `npci=0x3000` which also disables debugging of `gIOPCITunnelledKey`. Required when stuck at `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts related to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if `Above4GDecoding` can be enabled in BIOS**
**`-no_compat_check`**|Disables macOS compatibility check. For example, macOS 11.0 BigSur no longer supports iMac models introduced before 2014. Enabling this allows installing andd booting macOS on otherwise unsupported SMBIOS. Downside: you can't install system updates if this is enabled.

### GPU-specific boot arguments
For more iGPU and dGPU-related boot args see the Whatevergreen topic.

|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`agdpmod=pikera`**|Disables Board-ID checks on AMD Navi GPUs (RX 5000 & 6000 series). Without this you'll get a black screen. Don't use on Polaris or Vega Cards.
**`igfxonln=1`**|Forces all displays online. Resolves screen wake issues after quitting sleep mode in macOS 10.15.4 and newer when using Coffee and Comet Lake's Intel UHD 630.
**`-igfxvesa`** |Disables graphics acceleration in favor of software rendering. Useful if iGPU and dGPU are incompatible or if you are using an NVIDIA GeForce Card and the WebDrivers are outdated after updating macOS, so the display won't turn on during boot.
**`-wegnoegpu`**|Disables all GPUs but the integrated graphics on Intel CPU. Use if GPU is incompatible with macOS. Doesn't work all the time.
**`nvda_drv=1`**|Enable Web Drivers for NVIDIA Graphics Cards (supported up to macOS High Sierra only).
**`nv_disable=1`**|Disables NVIDIA GPUs (***don't*** combine this with `nvda_drv=1`)

### Network-specific boot arguments
|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`e1000=0`**|Prohibits `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from attaching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller used on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead. This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it may be required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs. You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.

### Other useful boot arguments
|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`alcid=1`**|For selecting a layout-id for AppleALC, whereas the numerical value specifies the layout-id. See [supported codecs](https://github.com/acidanthera/applealc/wiki/supported-codecs) to figure out which layout to use for your specific system.
**`amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1`**|Combines wit disabled SIP, this disables Apple Mobile File Integrity. AMFI is a macOS kernel module enforcing code-signing validation and library validation which strengthens security. Even after disabling these services, AMFI is still checking the signatures of every app that is run and will cause non-Apple apps to crash when they touch extra-sensitive areas of the system. There's also a [kext](https://github.com/osy/AMFIExemption) which does this on a per-app-basis.
**`-force_uni_control`**|Force-enables the Universal Control service in macOS Monteray 12.3+.

## Boot-args and device properties provided by kexts

### Lilu.kext
Assorted Lilu boot-args. Remember that Lilu acts as a patch engine providing functionality for other kexts in the hackintosh universe, so you got to be aware of that if you use any of these commands!

|Boot-arg|Description|
|:-------:|-----------|
**`-liluoff`**| Disables Lilu.
**`-lilubeta`**| Enables Lilu on unsupported macOS versions (macOS 12 and below are supported by default).
**`-lilubetaall`**| Enables Lilu and *all* loaded plugins on unsupported macOS (use _very_ carefully).
**`-liluforce`**| Enables Lilu regardless of the mode, OS, installer, or recovery.
