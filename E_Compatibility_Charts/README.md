## Picking the right SMBIOS
Choosing an appropriate SMBIOS for your Hackintosh is crucial if you want a smooth running and efficient system. You should chose your SMBIOS based on the following aspects:

- **CPU Vendor and product Family**: Intel? AMD? Mobile? Desktop? NUC? With or without iGPU support?
- **Discrete GPU**: Vendor and Model (ATI/AMD?, NVIDIA?)
- **macOS Version**: 
	- The used CPU family determines the optimal SMBIOS. 
	- Newest macOS versions most likely only support more recent SMBIOSes.
	
For an in-depth guide on choosing the best SMBIOS for your system, please refer to Dortania's [**SMBIOS Guide**](https://dortania-github-io.thrrip.space/OpenCore-Install-Guide/extras/smbios-support.html#how-to-decide)

### Notes regarding SMBIOS
Things you can do on Hackintoshes that you can't do on real Macs:

- Use higher/newer SMBIOSes to run newer versions of macOS on officially unsupported CPUs.
- Run older versions of macOS with newer/unknown CPUs by utilizing fake CPU-IDs.
- Make use of macOS 11.3+ virtualization capabilities to spoof a supported SMBIOS but let the hardware use the intended SMBIOS for your CPU! Check my [**Boad-ID VMM spoofing**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/09_Board-ID_VMM-Spoof) guide to find out how it works.

## AppleALC Layout IDs sorted by CODEC
This [repo](https://github.com/dreamwhite/ChonkyAppleALC-Build) contains all available AppleALC Layout IDs based on the name of the CODEC, while the official AppleALC repo [lists](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs) them all on one page.

1. Click on the folder for your vendor
2. Find the .md file for your CODEC 
3. Click to open it

Inside, you will find a list of all available Layout-IDs for the selected CODEC with additional info about the system/mainboard it has been created for.

So, if your mainboard uses [ALC1220](https://github.com/dreamwhite/ChonkyAppleALC-Build/blob/master/Realtek/ALC1220.md) for example, you could easily find out if someone already created a Layout ID for it.
