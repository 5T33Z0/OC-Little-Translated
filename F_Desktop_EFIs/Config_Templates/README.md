# What's this?

So, you've clicked on the "Database" button in OCAT in order to generate a pre-configured OpenCore EFI for your Intel CPU â€“ but all you got was a pop-up with a link redirecting you to my repo?

Well, the developer of OCAT removed direct access to the config templates stored in the database and instead redirected you here, since I am the maintainer of these config files. This makes it easier to keep maintain the config files and keep them up to date.
