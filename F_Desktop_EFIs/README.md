## About
This section contains generic OpenCore configs for Intel systems based on the work of **Gabriel Luchina** who created EFI folders following the instructions of Dortania's OpenCore install guide. I took his concept of base configs, modified and improved it so they work out of the box (hopefully). Nevertheless, it's crucial to understand that these configs serve only as a starting point for your system to get up and running with OpenCore.

## New approach: generating EFIs from `config.plist`
Instead of downloading pre-configured and possibly outdated OpenCore EFI folders from the internet, you can use OpenCore Auxiliary Tools ([**OCAT**](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools#readme)) to generate the whole EFI folder based on the a config.plist alone. This way, you always have the latest version of OpenCore, the config, kexts and drivers.

I've created about 40 base configs for Intel systems, covering a wide range of supported Desktop CPUs (1st to 10th Gen), vendors and chipsets. Laptop configs are omitted because there are way too many variables to consider to get it working flawlessly which is beyond the scope of what's possible with this method.

**No AMD?** Since configs for AMD systems also require many customizations before deployment (Kernel Patches, MMIO Whitelist, etc.), AMD templates have been removed from OCAT's database entirely.

### Included Files and Settings
- **Config Templates** for Intel Desktop and High End Desktop CPUs with variations for Dell, Sony, HP and other Board/Chipsets (no Laptops!)
- **Required SSDT** Hotpatches for each CPU family (some are disabled â€“ check before deployment!)
- **Necessary Quirks** for each CPU Family (also available as Presets inside of OCAT)
- **Device Properties** for each platform (mostly Framebuffer Patches for: iGPU only, iGPU+dGPU and GPU only)
- Base-set of **Kexts** (see chart below)
- `MinDate` and `MinVersion` for the APFS Driver set to `-1`, so all macOS versions are supported

## Instructions

### 1. Generate a base EFI Folder for the CPU of your choice
- [Download](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools/releases) and run OCAuxiliaryTools (OCAT)
- Open the **Database** <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>
- Click on the Link 
- Select a config for your CPU family and click on it
- On the toolbar above the code, click on the button that says "Download raw file"
- Open the .plist in OCAT (or drag it into the main window)
- Go to `PlatformInfo/Generic` and click the `Generate` button (next to the SMBIOS dropdown menu)
- Select "Edit" > "Create EFI Folder on Desktop"

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Each config.plist contains notes (`#Info`). You can see them if you open the config with a plist editor.
> - There's also a [zipped version](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/raw/main/F_Desktop_EFIs/Config_Templates/Config_Templates.zip) which contains all config templates.

### 2. Modifying the `config.plist` 
After the base EFI has been generated, the `config.plist` has to be modified based on the used CPU, GPU, additional hardware, peripherals and SMBIOS.

- Go to the Desktop
- Open the `config.plist` included in `\EFI\OC\` with **OCAT** or **ProperTree**
- Check the following Sections and Settings:
	Section |Setting(s)
	--------|---------
	**ACPI/Add** |Add extra ACPI Tables if your hardware configuration requires them. 2nd to 3rd Gen Intel Core CPUs require `SSDT-PM` (create it in Post-Install).
	**DeviceProperties**| `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`: check if the correct [**Framebuffer Patch**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/11_Graphics/iGPU/iGPU_DeviceProperties.md) is enabled for your hardware configuration and adjust it accordingly (the `model` property for details). Entries with a `#` are disabled (&rarr; see [Additional Configuration Notes](#additional-configuration-notes)).
	**Kernel/Add** | Add extra kexts required for your hardware and features (WiFi and Bluetooth come to mind). A base-set required for the selected system is already included.
	**PlatformInfo/Generic** |Generate `SMBIOS` Data for the selected Mac model
	**NVRAM/Add/7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82**| Add additional boot-args if your hardware requires them (&rarr; see [Additional Configuration Notes](#additional-configuration-notes)).
- Save the config.plist
- Copy the EFI folder to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive
- Reboot from the flash drive and test if it works
- If it does, mount your system's EFI and put the EFI folder in there.
- If it doesn't you have to check the config again, following Dortania's [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).
- If all settings are correct, check the [troubleshooting guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html)
- If you find a config error in the config template itself, please create an issue report and I will fix it.

### 3. Post-Install: fixing CPU Power Management on Sandy and Ivy Bridge CPUs
2nd and 3rd Gen Intel CPUs use a different method for CPU Power Management. Use [**ssdtPRGen**](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh) to generate a `SSDT-PM.aml` in Post-Install, add it to your `EFI\OC\ACPI` folder and config to get proper CPU Power Management.

You can follow [**my guide**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/CPU_Power_Management/CPU_Power_Management_(Legacy)) to do so.

## Additional Configuration Notes
Before deploying your newly generated EFI folder, check the following:

- Open the `config.plist` in a Plist Editor to find additional info and notes
- View `DeviceProperties` to check the included Framebuffer-Patches. Usually, 2 Frambuffer Patches are included ([**List of available Framebuffer Patches**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/11_Graphics/iGPU/iGPU_DeviceProperties.md)):
	- One for using the iGPU for driving a Display 
	- One for using the iGPU for computational tasks only (if a supported discrete GPU is present). 
- Depending on your hardware configuration (CPU, iGPU, dGPU, Mainboard, other peripherals) you may have to add additional SSDT Hotpatches, boot-args, DeviceProperties and/or Kexts!
- Cross-Reference with Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide for your CPU family to double-check and verify the config.
- For Troubleshooting, please consult Dortania's [**OC Troubleshooting Guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/kernel-issues.html#stuck-on-eb-log-exitbs-start)

### Additional `boot-args`
Depending on the combination of CPU, GPU (iGPU and/or dGPU) and SMBIOS, additional `boot-args` may be required. These are not included in the configs and need to be added manually before deploying the EFI folder!

#### GPU-specific boot-args
|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`agdpmod=pikera`**|Disables Board-ID checks on AMD Navi GPUs (RX 5000 & 6000 series). Without this you'll get a black screen. Don't use on Navi Cards (i.e. Polaris and Vega).
**`-igfxvesa`**|Disables graphics acceleration in favor of software rendering. Useful if iGPU and dGPU are incompatible or if you are using an NVIDIA GeForce Card and the WebDrivers are outdated after updating macOS, so the display won't turn on during boot.
**`-wegnoegpu`**|Disables all external/discrete GPUs except integrated graphics. Use if your GPU is incompatible with macOS. Doesn't work all the time.
**~~`nvda_drv=1`~~**|Enables Web Drivers for NVIDIA Graphics Cards (supported up to macOS High Sierra only). In OpenCore you have to add the following key to **NVRAM/Add/7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82** instead:</br>![webdrv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/215419237-e7c9e104-bb96-4d88-95c7-a1a9584e746e.png)
**`nv_disable=1`**|Disables NVIDIA GPUs (***don't*** combine this with `nvda_drv=1`)

#### Debugging
|Boot-arg|Description|
|:------:|-----------|
**`-v`**|Verbose Mode. Replaces the progress bar with a terminal output with a bootlog which helps resolving issues. Combine with `debug=0x100` and `keepsyms=1`
**`debug=0x100`**|Disables macOS'es watchdog. Prevents the machine from restarting on a kernel panic. That way you can hopefully glean some useful info and follow the breadcrumbs to get past the issues.
**`keepsyms=1`**|Companion setting to `debug=0x100` that tells the OS to also print the symbols on a kernel panic. That can give some more helpful insight as to what's causing the panic itself.
**`dart=0`**|Disables VT-x/VT-d. Nowadays, `DisableIOMapper` Quirk is used instead.
**`cpus=1`**|Limits the number of CPU cores to 1. Helpful in cases where macOS won't boot or install otherwise.
**`npci=0x2000`**/</br>**`npci=0x3000`**|Disables PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`. Alternatively, use `npci=0x3000` which also disables debugging of `gIOPCITunnelledKey`. Required when stuck at `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts related to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if `Above4GDecoding` can be enabled in BIOS**
**`-no_compat_check`**|Disables macOS compatibility check. For example, macOS 11.0 BigSur no longer supports iMac models introduced before 2014. Enabling this allows installing and booting macOS on otherwise unsupported SMBIOS. Downside: you can't install system updates if this is enabled. A better solution is to add Booter Patches to enable the board-id skip and add RestrictEvents to enable system updates as explained [here](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/S_System_Updates)
