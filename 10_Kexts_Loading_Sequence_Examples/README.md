## About

This Chapter contains a collection of `config.plist` examples to demonstrate the loading sequences for certain kexts and family of kexts. 

In contrast to Clover, where just drop required kexts to `Clover\kexts\other` folder, OpenCore loads kexts in the exact order as listed in the `Kernel/Add` section of the `config.plist`. And if this order is incorrect, your system either won't boot or will crash during boot!

In general, kexts which provide additional functionality for other kexts have to be loaded first. Config 1 contains the loading sequence for the most essential kexts that are required by almost every Hackintosh to boot. These are:

1. **Lilu.kext**
2. **VirtualSMC.kext** (+ Sensor Plugins) or **FakeSMC.kext** (+ optional Sensor Plugins)
3. **Whatevergreen**

The rest of the config examples show the loading sequences for `Bluetooth`, `Wifi`, `Keyboards` and `Trackpad` kexts because these contain additional kexts nested inside them which have to be loaded in the correct order to work correctly. Not having them in the correct order may cause Kernel Panics. 

Same goes for having kexts in the list which aren't present in the `OC/Kexts` folder. So it's of utmost importance that the kexts are loaded in the correct order and that the content of the `config.plist` reflect the kexts present in the OC folder 1:1. The examples listed below provide a solid guideline on how to organize and combine kexts.

For additional information about available kexts, read the [**Kext documentation**](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Kexts.md) on the OpenCore Github.

## General Kernel and Kext handling by OpenCore
OpenCore handles the `Kernel` section of the `config.plist` in the following order (since version 0.9.2, Commit 6a65dd1):

- `Block` is processed
- `Add` and `Force` are processed
- `Emulate` and `Quirks` are processed
- `Patch` is processed

**NOTE**: Prior to this commit, `Add` and `Force` where last in the chain which made it impossible to patch force-injected kexts.

## Lilu and VirtualSMC first?
Although it is recommended to load **Lilu** and **VirtualSMC** first in order to simplfy kext-related troubleshooting, ***this is not a requirement per se***. **Lilu** and **VirtualSMC** only need to load *prior to any kexts that rely on them*. `ProperTree` cross-references `CFBundleIdentifiers` against `OSBundleLibraries` to ensure the correct loading order of kexts when creating a config snapshot.  For reviewers of configs who try to assist other users in fixing config issues, this complicates troubleshooting.

:bulb: **Tip**: When in doubt, either create a (new) snapshot in ProperTree or place **Lilu** and **VirtualSMC** first to eliminate kext dependency issues altogether! In my experience, placing Lilu and VirtualSMC first also improves boot times.

## Kernel Support Table
Listed below, you will find the Kernel version ranges for macOS 10.4 to macOS 13. Setting `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` for kexts is very useful to maximize the compatibility of your `config.plist` with various versions of macOS without having to create multiple configs with different sets of kexts. This way, you can control which kexts are enabled for which macOS version by specifying the kernel range. It's basically the same feature Clover provides, just a lot smarter: instead of using sub-folders labeled by the macOS Version (10.15, 11, 12, etc.), you specify the lower and upper kernel limit. This way you don't have to create duplicates of kexts (which you maybe forget to update later).

This is especially useful for:

- Bluetooth and WiFi kexts where certain macOS versions require different sets of kexts
- Kexts which are only required by certain versions of macOS, like CryptexFixup (Ventura only) or NoTouchID.kext (High Sierra to Mojave only)

This way, you can leave all kexts enabled but control which ones will be loaded by setting the Kernel range. Check "Example 7" which makes use of this technique extensively.

|OS X/macOS Version (Name) | MinKernel | MaxKernel| Architecture
|-------------------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:-----------:
OS X 10.4 (Tiger)          | 8.0.0     | 8.99.99  |PPC and Intel</br> (32/64-bit)
OS X 10.5 (Leopard)        | 9.0.0     | 9.99.99  | "

macOS 11 (Big Sur) | 20.0.0    | 20.99.99 |Intel (64-bit)</br>Apple Silicon (ARM)
macOS 12 (Monterey)| 21.0.0    | 21.99.99 |"
macOS 13 (Ventura) | 22.0.0    | 22.99.99 |"

:bulb: To find out which Kernel your current macOS install is running, either enter `uname -r` in Terminal or look it up in the System Profiler under "Software". Although `MaxKernel` can go up to `X.99.99`, using `X.9.9` is sufficient in most cases. So far, there hasn't been a version of macOS which uses a Kernel greater than `X.9.9`. 

## Examples
### Example 1: Mandatory kexts (Minimal Requirements)
![config01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140840864-e7596685-d2bf-426d-af92-4f23fa01f18a.png)</br>
Any additional kexts must be placed after the mandatory kexts.
### Example 2: ApplePS2SmartTouchPad + Plugins (Laptop)
![Config2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140813746-3d3ab6aa-949a-4b91-8c9b-c3dcd0fef77d.png)
### Example 3: VoodooPS2 + TrackPad (Laptop)
![config3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140813775-eb6ff60f-9ec3-4c9b-a768-f5e5a9e6868e.png)
### Example 4: VoodooPS2 + I2C (Laptop)
![config4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140813798-a403f299-e85d-4fed-90f7-bea045384db5.png)
### Example 5: VoodooPS2 + VoodooRMI + VoodooSMBus (Laptop)
For Synaptics TrackPads which are controlled via SMBus, the kext order is:

![Voodoo_RMI_SMBUS](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/5bcb3370-2094-4c91-b813-c9eab5cd2901)

**SOURCE**: [**VoodooSMBus**](https://github.com/VoodooSMBus/VoodooRMI#installation)

### Example 6: VoodooPS2 + VoodooRMI + VoodooI2C (Laptop)
For Synaptics TrackPads which are controlled via I2C, the kext order is:

![Voodoo_RMI_I2C](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/d7010ea1-89f3-4a10-b9ab-acb920bd180b)

**SOURCE**: [**VoodooSMBus**](https://github.com/VoodooSMBus/VoodooRMI#installation)

### Example 7: Broadcom WiFi and Bluetooth 

![BRCM_WIFI_BT](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/872fc20c-9bf5-4fa9-95ad-02d36f0f69b2)

When using Broadcom WiFi/Bluetooth cards that are not natively supported by macOS, you have to be aware about the following:

1. Kexts have to be loaded in the correct order/sequence (otherwise boot crashes). When in doubt, create an OC Snapshot in ProperTree â€“ it can fix the order if it's incorrect.
2. You have to make use of `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` settings to control which kexts are loaded for different versions of macOS
3. `AirportBrcomFixup` is for enabling WiFi. It contains 2 additional kexts as Plugins (only one of them should be enabled at any time):
	- `AirPortBrcmNIC_Injector.kext` (compatible with macOS 10.13 and newer)
	- `AirPortBrcm4360_Injector.kext` (compatible with macOS 10.8 to 10.15)
4. For Bluetooth, various kexts and combinations are necessary:
	- `BlueToolFixup.kext`: For macOS 12 and newer. Contains Firmware Data (MinKernel 21.0).
	- `BrcmFirmwareData.kext`: contains necessary firmware. Required for macOS 10.8 to 11.x (MaxKernel 20.9.9)
	- `BrcmPatchRAM.kext`: For 10.10 or earlier
	- `BrcmPatchRAM2.kext`: For macOS 10.11 to 10.14
	- `BrcmPatchRAM3.kext`: For macOS 10.15 to 11.x. Needs to be combined with `BrcmBluetoothInjector.kext` in order to work.
5. With the release of macOS Sonoma Developer Preview (Darwin Kernel 23.0), Apple completely dropped support for Broadcom Cards!  

> **Warning**: Don't add `BrcmFirmwareRepo.kext` to `EFI/OC/Kexts`! It cannot be injected via Boot Managers. It needs to be installed in `/System/Library/Extensions` (/Library/Extensions on 10.11 and later). In this case, `BrcmFirmwareData.kext`is not required.  You can use [**Kext-Droplet**](https://github.com/chris1111/Kext-Droplet-macOS) to install kext on the system directly.

#### :bulb: Fixing issues with AirportBrcmFixup generating a lot of crash reports

I've noticed recently that a lot of crash reports for `com.apple.drive.Airport.Brcm4360.0` and `com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family` are being generated (located under /Library/Logs/CrashReporter/CoreCapture) although my WiFi card is working great in terms of connectivity and speed.

This issue is related to Smart Connect, a feature of WiFi routers which support 2,4 gHz and 5 gHz basebands to make the WiFi card switch between the two automatically depending on the signal quality. Turning off Smart Connect in the router resolves this issue.

### Example 8: Intel WiFi and Bluetooth 
![IntelBT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/196041542-9f6943dc-b500-408e-8d61-f15a6082d5f7.png)

For macOS Monterey and newer, [**read this**](https://openintelwireless.github.io/IntelBluetoothFirmware/FAQ.html#what-additional-steps-should-i-do-to-make-bluetooth-work-on-macos-monterey-and-newer).

### Example 9a: Possible Desktop Kext Sequence
![config9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140826181-073a2204-aacb-435e-970c-1823cd2786d1.png)

Most Intel Desktop configs will at least contain `Lilu`, `VirtualSMC` (Plugins are optional), `WhateverGreen` and `AppleALC`. This example excludes USB Port, Ethernet and WiFi/BT kexts!

### Example 9b: Possible Laptop Kext Sequence
![config9b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/140829571-525840b9-f7e5-4abb-8cd9-3aa0e31867a9.png)

This is how a possible sequence of kexts for a Laptop might look. In this example, the Trackpad requires `VoodooPS2Controller`, WiFi and BT are by Intel and the Ethernet card is from Realtek. Depending on your Laptop components, Kexts 10 to 17 could be something else entirely.

> **Note**: VirtualSMC sensor plugins
>
>- Dell users can add `SMCDellSensors` for temperature monitoring and fan control.
>- If your laptop has a built-in compatible brightness sensor, you can add `SMCLightSensor` 

## Notes
- :warning: The plists included in this section ARE NOT for use with any system. The are only examples for demonstrating the order of the kexts listed in "Kernel/Add" section!
- Ignore the red dots in the screenshots. 
- The kexts listed in Examples 2 to 6 are for PS2 Controllers (Keyboards, Mice, Trackpads). We recommend to use `config-2-PS2-Controller` plist as a starting point.
