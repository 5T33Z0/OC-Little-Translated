# Debugging
This chapter covers the OpenCore's `SysReport` feature which can be used to gather useful information about the system.

## Using OpenCore's `SysReport` feature
With the "Debug" version of OpenCore you can generate dumps of ACPI tables, the Audio CODEC, CPU details, SMBIOS and PCI devices, located in a "SysReport" folder inside the EFI partition:

![SysReport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/168154869-30725020-0247-4e9f-95fc-e27d733b9ef6.png)

In order to do so, you have to enable the `SysReport` feature in the config.plist. After rebooting the files will be available.

### Preparation and dumping process
Normally, you would need an already working config and the Debug version of OpenCore to do this. But the guys from Utopia-Team have prepared a generic, pre-build [**Debug EFI**](https://github.com/utopia-team/opencore-debug/releases) which can do it *without* a working config. It contains all necessary files and settings required to create a `SysReport`.

1. Download the EFI.zip and extract it
2. Copy the EFI folder to a FAT32 formatted flash drive
3. Reboot your system from the flash drive
4. The dumping process will beginn: 
![Dumping Process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46293832/168248420-128f8d51-30fd-49b6-87e1-7ef95e92abf7.jpg)

Once you reach OpenCore's boot picker, you can remove the flash drive and reset the system. The files are stored on the flash drive now and you can check them out.

## About the dumped files
### ACPI
With `SysReport` enabled, ACPI tables will be dumped which then can be further analyzed to see which [**SSDTs**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features#readme) you might have to add in order to enable or add additional features.

**NOTE**: When it comes to obtaining ACPI easily, Clover is the better option since it can do this from the GUI without having a working config (simply press F11 and the tables will be dumped to the USB flash drive).

#### Debugging ACPI Tables
See Section &rarr; [ACPI Debugging](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/00_About_ACPI/ACPI_Debugging#readme)

### Audio
With `SysReport` and the `AudioDxe.efi` driver enabled, OpenCore will create an Audio CODEC dump.

Unfortunately, the dump gathered by OpenCore doesn't work in codecgraph which is an important tool for creating Layout-IDs for AppleALC. It generates a schematic of the CODEC dump data which shows the connecters, nodes and routings, etc:

![codec_dump txt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/168449513-290186d6-3ada-4689-a438-eb268ffb18ad.svg)

Therefore, you need to create the CODEC dump in Linux.

#### Preparing a USB flash drive for running Linux from an ISO
Users who already have Linux installed can skip this!

1. Get a USB 3.0 flash drive (at least 8 GB or more)
2. In Windows, download [**Ventoy**](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) and follow the [**Instructions**](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html) to prepare your USB flash drive. It's pretty straight forward.
3. Next, Download an ISO of a Linux distribution of your choice, e.g. [**Ubuntu**](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
4. Copy the ISO to your newly created Ventoy stick
5. Reboot from the flash drive
6. In the Ventoy Menu, select the Linux ISO and hit enter
7. From the GNU Grub, select "Try or Install Linux"
8. Once Ubuntu has reached the Desktop environmen, select "Try Ubuntu"

#### Dumping the Audio CODEC
1. Once Linux is up and running, open Terminal and enter: `cd ~/Desktop && mkdir CodecDump && for c in /proc/asound/card*/codec#*; do f="${c/\/*card/card}"; cat "$c" > CodecDump/${f//\//-}.txt; done && zip -r CodecDump.zip CodecDump`
2. Store the generated `CodecDump.zip` on a medium (HDD, other USB stick, E-Mail, Cloud) which you can access later from within macOS. You cannot store it on the Ventoy USB stick itself unfortunately, since it's formatted in ExFat which can't be accessed by Linux without additional measures.
3. Reboot into macOS
4. Extract `CodecDump.zip` to the Desktop
5. Rename `card0-codec#0.txt` located in the "CodecDump" folder to `codec_dump.txt`

### CPU
In the CPU folder you'll find `CPUInfo.txt`, which contains all sorts of details about the CPU in use: Name, Frequency, Cores, Threads, Number of Speedstaps, AppleProcessorType (might be interesting if it's not detected correctly by macOS), etc.

### PCI
Besides analyzing ACPI tales such as the `DSDT`, the `PCIInfo.txt` located in the `PCI` folder includes useful information about hardware components which can help to figure out which additional kext sor SSDTs you may need. Although Hackintool shows a list of some PCI devices, the PCIInfo.txt shows all. The example below is from my Lenovo T530 Laptop.

With the python script [**PCILookup**](https://github.com/dreamwhite/PCILookup), we can reformat the PCIInfo.txt to a more legible form:

- Install Python
- Download and upack the Script
- Run Terminal
- Typce `cd`, hit space
- Drop the "PCILookup-master" folder in the terminal window and hit enter 
- Next, type `python3 main.py` and hit space
- Drag in the `PCIInfo.txt` and hit enter

As you can see, devices 12 and 18 don't have a known/valid Vendor ID (`ffff`). That's the reason why they're not listed by Hackintool. So as far analyzing PCI is concerned you are better off using Hackintool, if the system is already up and running.

**NOTE**: Device-IDs of PCIInfo and Hackintool will differ whether you spoof Device-IDs via DeviceProperties or via ACPI, to make a component work in macOS (iGPUs, dGPUS, SATA Controller or LAN Adapters come to mind).
