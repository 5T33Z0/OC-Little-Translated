## About
The stock firmware of the Intel I225-V Ethernet Controller used on some Gigabyte Z490 Boards contains incorrect Subsystem-ID and Subsystem Vendor-ID infos. The Vendor-ID (`8086`, for Intel) is also used as Subsystem-Vendor-ID (instead of `1458`) and the Subsystem-ID only contains zeros instead of the correct value (`E000`). This results in Internet not working on macOS Monterey and newer since it cannot connect to the necessary driver. Apply this fix to re-enable Internet in macOS Monterey and newer.

## Adding SSDT-I225-V
Use the attached SSDT to inject the correct header descriptions for the Intel I225-V into macOS Monterey and newer. 

For macOS 13, you also need to inject `AppleIntel210Ethernet.kext`, since it has been removed from the `IONetworkingFamily.kext` and you can't use the .dext version unless you flash a modded firmware.

:warning: Before deploying this SSDT, verify the ACPI path of the I225-V is matching the one used in your `DSDT` â€“ otherwise adjust it accordingly! You can use Hackintool and IO RegistryExplorer to find the correct ACPI path.

> **Note**: Location of AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext in previous versions of macOS: `System/Library/Extensions/IONetworkingFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/`

### Instructions

- Disable/Delete `FakePCIID.kext` (if present)
- Disable/Delete `FakePCIID_Intel_I225-V.kext` (if present)
- [**Download**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/Intel_I225-V_Fix_(SSDT-I225V)/SSDT-I225V.aml?raw=true) `SSDT-I225V.aml`
- Add it to `EFI/OC/ACPI` and config.plist 
- **macOS 13 only**: 
	- Add [**this kext**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/raw/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/Intel_I225-V_Fix_(SSDT-I225V)/AII210E.zip) 
	- Set `MinKernel` to `22.0.0` so it's only injected into macOS Ventura!
- Add boot-arg `dk.e1000=0` (macOS 11) and/or `e1000=0` (macOS 12+)
- Apply the correct **Settings** from the table below.
- Save the config and reboot.

## Settings
Listed below are the required BIOS and config Settings for various versions of macOS.

macOS |Vt-D|DisableIoMapper|DMAR (OEM)|DMAR (dropped/replaced)[^1]| I225-V / 3rd Party working|
:-----|:------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------:
12.5+ (with SSDT)| ON |**OFF**| **YES** | **NO / NO**| **YES / YES**
12.5+ (stock fw) | ON | OFF | YES| NO / NO | **NO / YES**
11.4 to 11.6.7 | ON | ON [^2]| NO | YES / YES | [**YES / YES**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Gigabyte-Z490-Vision-G-Hackintosh-OpenCore/issues/19#issuecomment-1153315826)
10.15 to 11.3 [^3]| OFF/ON |OFF/ON | YES | NO / NO | **YES / NO**

[^1]: Check my guide for [dropping ACPI tables](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/00_About_ACPI/ACPI_Dropping_Tables#readme) for details
[^2]: Combining `Vt-D` and `DisableIOMapper` makes no sense to me in regards to enabling the I225-V in macOS but that's what the user reported as working.
[^3]: Enabling the I225-V in macOS Catalina requires modified DeviceProperties as well as a Kernel Patch since it's not supported natively. With this, the Controller will be spoofed as an Intel I219 and work. Copy the settings from the attached "I225_Catalina.plist" into your Config. Disable the DeviceProperties for anything newer than macOS 11.3!

> **Note**: OpenCore 0.9.2 introduced a new Quirk called `DisableIoMapperMapping`. It works independently of `DisableIoMapper` and removes Reserved Memory Regions defined in the DMAR table from memory in macOS, so dropping and replacing the DMAR table is no longer required. Refer to OpenCore's Documentation.pdf for more details.

## Troubleshooting

If you are facing issues afterwards, you could try attaching the I225-V to the `AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext` by using boot boot-arg `dk.e1000=0` (Big Sur) or `e1000=0` (macOS Monterey/Ventura).

If you can't access the Internet after flashing the custom firmware, remove the following preferences via Terminal and reboot and reset kext cache:

- `sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist`
- `sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist`
- `sudo kextcache -i /`

After a few seconds, the connection should work. If you still can't access the Internet, delete the following preferences followed by a reboot:

- `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.necp.plist`
- `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.plist`
- `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.networkextension.uuidcache.plist`
