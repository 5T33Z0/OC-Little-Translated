## About
This patch attaches an AC Adapter Device existing in a Laptop's `DSDT` to the `AppleACPIACAdapter` service in the IORegistry of macOS. This is optional and mostly cosmetic â€“ it doesn't make any difference in terms of functionality as explained [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/1808).

If you are using **VirtualSMC** with the **SMCBatteryManager** plugin, you don't need to add this SSDT. Read the notes about **ACPIBatteryManager** vs. **SMCBatteryManager** below for more details.

**Applicable to SMBIOS**: MacBook, MacBookAir and MacBookPro. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> This SSDT hotfix has to be considered non-functionol or cosmetic since VirtualSMC's SMCBatteryManagement plugin takes care of all of this.

## Preparations
- In `DSDT`, search for `ACPI0003` and the device it belongs to: either `AC`, `AC0`, `ADP`, `ADP1` or `ACAD`. 
- In this example, it's present and located under `\SB.PCI0.LPC.EC.AC`:

- Next, run **IORegistryExplorer** and find either of these devices: `AC`, `AC0`, `ADP0`, `ADP1` or `ACAD` (it should be located at the top of the list)
- Check if `AppleACPIACAdapter` is loaded. If it's present (as in this example) you don't need the fix:</br> ![AppleACPIACAdapter_present](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139686991-d0104672-31f1-4ccf-949b-cd44ff9a4537.png)
- If `AppleACPIACAdapter` is missing, you can add a variant of `SSDT-AC` to fix it: </br>![AppleACPIACAdapter_missing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139687029-acdd7853-6d7c-43fc-b421-f2c718af45c2.png)

## Applying the patch
There are 2 methods of applying this patch: either via kext or via SSDT. 

### Method 1: Using a Kext (easy but outdated)
- Add `ACPIBatteryManager.kext` to your EFI's kext folder and config. 
- Disable `SMCBatteryManager.kext` (if present).
- Save and reboot

`ACPIBatteryManager.kext` attaches the AC Adapter device to the `AppleACPIACAdapter` service. Additionally, it also applies some settings related to power management and attaches `BAT0` to `AppleSmartBatteryManger` in **IORegistryExplorer**.

#### ACPIBatteryManager vs. SMCBatteryManager
`SMCBatteryManager` is a virtual controller, which implements a complete emulation layer of `AppleSmartBattery` and its SMC and SMBus protocols. Although it is able to find all AC Adapters and Batteries just fine, it doesn't attach them to `ACPIACAdapter` and `AppleSmartBattery` services like `ACPIBatteryManager` does which is all cosmetic.

Note that in order for `ACPIBatteryManager` to work properly, in most cases (if the EC registers exceed 8-bit) additional [battery patches](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/05_Laptop-specific_Patches/Battery_Patches) are required to enable the Battery Status indicator in macOS. Nowadays you can use [**`ECEnabler.kext`**](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) to enable it without additional patches but it's not guaranteed to work on every system.

If you want to be on the safe side, use `SMCBatteryManager` since it is in active development, whereas `ACPIBatteryManager` hasn't been updated since 2018.

### Method 2: Using a SSDT (for advanced users)
If `AppleACPIACAdapter` is not loaded, you can use one of the included SSDT hotpatches to attach it to the AC Adapter. Do the following, to figure out which SSDT is applicable:

- In your `DSDT`, search for `ACPI0003`. 
- Open the SSDT corresponding to your AC device's name in maciASL and adjust the PCI path according to the path used in your `DSDT`.
- In this example, `SSDT-AC.dsl` is used and modified, so it looks like this: ![SSDT_mod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/139687058-6fad207b-019a-4253-a91e-c87011f17922.png)</br>
- Export the file as an `.aml` file (ACPI Machine Language Binary)
- Put it the ACPI Folder, add it to your `config.plist` and enable it.
- Save and reboot.

## Verifying the patch
After rebooting, check if `AppleACPIACAdapter` is present in **IORegistryExplorer**:

![ACAdaptr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/146288651-24a88e8a-fc8e-4354-b54f-7e96de2e6cfd.png)

If you use the ACPIBatteryManager.kext, it also links the battery to the `AppleSmartBatteryManager` service:

![Bat0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/146288737-8284846d-8fc1-489b-96f6-bb5b804828ab.png)

If it's not present, then you did something wrong, so start over.

## NOTES
- Ensure that the PCI path of the LPC Bus (`LPC` or `LPCB`) used in the SSDT is consistent with the one used in your system's `DSDT`. 
- In Clover, you can use the DSDT patch `FixADP1` instead to attach the AC device in IOReg.
