# Adding a fake Embedded Controller (`SSDT-EC`) or (`SSDT-EC-USBX`) 

## About Embedded Controllers
An embedded controller (or `EC`) is a hardware microcontroller inside of computers (especially Laptops) that can handle a lot of different tasks: from receiving and processing signals from keyboards and/or touchpads, thermal measurements, managing the battery, handling switches and LEDs, handling USB power, Bluetooth toggle, etc., etc.

### Why do I need a virtual EC?
On Desktop PCs, the Embedded Controller usually isn't named correctly for macOS, so it can't attach to the `AppleACPIEC` driver. In this case this is a good thing, since `EC` devices from PCs are usually incompatible with macOS and may break at any time. In other words: on Desktops, `AppleACPIEC` kext must be prevented from connecting to an existing `EC`. To ensure thes, we disable the device in the system's `DSDT` and add a fake/virtual `EC` for macOS to play with instead.

### `SSDT-EC` or `SSDT-EC-USBX`: which one do I need?
In order to get USB Power Management working properly on **Skylake and newer CPUs**, we have to add a fake `EC` as well as a `USBX` device to supply USB power properties, so macOS can attach its `AppleBusPowerController` service to it. Both devices are included in `SSDT-EC-USBX`. For older systems, `SSDT-EC` alone is sufficient (if required at all).

On Laptops, the `EC` microcontroller actually really exists but may be not detected because macOS expects a different name than what's provided by the system's `DSDT`. In this case we just use a fake EC to keep macOS happy.

#### SSDT-EC vs SSDT-EC-USBX in a nutshell

- On **Desktops**, an existing `EC` has to be disabled and a fake EC has to be added.
- On **Laptops**, we just need an additional fake EC to be present (not always required).
- **Skylake** and newer Intel CPUs require `SSDT-EC-USBX`, older CPUs only require `SSDT-EC`.

## Adding a fake EC Device
There are 2 methods for adding a fake or virtual EC: either by manually editing the required SSDT sample (Method 1) or by using SSDTTime, which can generate the required SSDT-EC automatically based on analyzing the DSDT (Method 2).

Use either one method or the other, not both! :warning: DON'T rename `EC0`, `H_EC`, etc. to `EC` with binary renames. These devices are incompatible with macOS and may break at any time. `AppleACPIEC` kext must NOT load on desktops.

### Method 1: Manual patching method (recommended)
- In the `DSDT`, search for `PNP0C09` 
- If multiple devices with the EisaID `PNP0C09` are discovered, confirm that it belongs to an EC Device (`EC`, `H_EC`, `EC0`, etc.).
- Depending on the type of system you are using, open either `SSDT-EC.dsl`, `SSDT-EC-USBX_Desktop.dsl` or `SSDT-EC-USBX_Laptop.dsl`
- Modify the chosen SSDT as needed so the PCI paths and name of the Low Pin Configuration Bus according to what's used in your `DSDT` (either `LPCB`or `LPC`). Read the comments in the .dsl files for more instructions.
- Export the file as .aml (ACPI Machine Language Binary) and add it to EFI/OC/ACPI and your Config
- Save and Reboot.

#### Additional Steps (Desktop PCs only)
To ensure that the existing EC in your `DSDT` does not attach to the `AppleACPIEC` driver, do the following after rebooting:

- Run [**IORegistryExplorer**](https://github.com/khronokernel/IORegistryClone)
- Search for the name of your real EC controller (`EC0`, `H_EC`, etc.)  If the device is not present, you're done!
- If the device is present (exact match!), you have to disable it. 
- Open the previously used .dsl file and remove the comments `/*` and `*/ `from the following section, so it's no longer displayed in green in MaciASL:
	```asl
    External (_SB_.PCI0.LPCB.EC0, DeviceObj)

    Scope (\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC0)
    {
        Method (_STA, 0, NotSerialized)  // _STA: Status
        {
            If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
            {
                Return (0) // Disables EC0 in macOS!
            }
            Else
            {
                Return (0x0F) // Leaves EC0 enabled for all other OSes!
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- Adjust the device name and PCI path accordingly to what's used in you `DSDT`
- Export the file as .aml
- Replace the existing file in EFI/OC/ACPI
- Reboot
- Check IORegistryExplorer again for `EC0`, `H_EC` or whatever the device is called in your `DSDT`.
- If it's not present, you're done.

### Method 2: automated SSDT generation using SSDTTime
**SSDTTime** is a python script which can generate various SSDTs by analyzing your system's `DSDT`. Unfortunately, SSDT-EC tables generated by SSDTTime **do not include the `USBX` Device**. You have to generate an additional `SSDT-USBX` in this case.

**HOW TO:**

1. Download [**SSDTTime**](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) and run it
2. Pres "D", drag in your system's DSDT and hit "ENTER"
3. Generate all the SSDTs you need.
4. The SSDTs will be stored under `Results` inside the `SSDTTime-master`Folder along with `patches_OC.plist`.
5. Copy the generated `SSDTs` to EFI/OC/ACPI and your Config using OpenCore Auxiliary Tools
6. Open `patches_OC.plist` and copy the included patches to your `config.plist` (to the same section, of course).
7. Save and Reboot. Done.

**Tip**: If you are editing your config using [**OpenCore Auxiliary Tools**](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig/releases), OCAT it will update the list of kexts and .aml files automatically, since it monitors the EFI folder.

## Adding the correct current values to `USBX` device
Inside the **SSDT-EC-USBX.aml** tables, you'll also find the `USBX` device which is present in DSDTs of real Macs with Intel Skylake and newer CPUs. It contains electrical current values in hex. Older models and versions of macOS don't have an `USBX` device but rather use values stored in the [IOUSBHostFamily.kext](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-usb-power-property-injection-for-sierra-and-later.222266/), in other words, it's handled by macOS (up to 10.12).

Below you'll find the default USB power properties used in the SSDT-EC-USBX files.

**For PCs**:

```asl
...
Return (Package (0x08)
{	
    "kUSBSleepPowerSupply", 
    0x13EC,
    "kUSBSleepPortCurrentLimit", 
    0x0834,
    "kUSBWakePowerSupply",
    0x13EC, 
    "kUSBWakePortCurrentLimit", 
    0x0834
})
...
```
**For Noetbooks/NUCs**:

```asl
...
Return (Package (0x08)
{	
    "kUSBSleepPortCurrentLimit", 
    0x0BB8,
    "kUSBWakePortCurrentLimit", 
    0x0BB8
})
...
```
Depending on the SMBIOS you are using, you may have to adjust these values accordingly. You find the values used in the real Macs in the following table.

|SMBIOS|kUSBSleepPowerSupply|kUSBSleepPortCurrentLimit|kUSBWakePowerSupply|kUSBWakePortCurrentLimit|
|-------|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
**iMacPro1,1**|0x13EC|0x0834|0x13EC|0x0834

||||||
**MacPro7,1**|0x13EC|0x0834|0x13EC|0x0834|
MacPro6,1 and older|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A

As you can see, desktop machines (iMac, iMacPro and MacPrp) use the same values, whereas the values for notebooks and MacMinis differ.
