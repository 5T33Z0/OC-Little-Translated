# Enabling CPU Power Management (`SSDT-PLUG`)

## Description
Enables `X86PlatformPlugin` to implement XCPM CPU Power Management on 4th Gen Intel Core CPUs and newer. AMD CPUs require [**SSDT-CPUR.aml**](https://github.com/dortania/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/blob/master/extra-files/compiled/SSDT-CPUR.aml) instead.

## Patching method 1: automated, using SSDTTime
The manual patchinf method described below is outdated, since the patching process can now be automated using **SSDTTime** which can generate the following SSDTs based on analyzing your system's `DSDT`:

* ***SSDT-AWAC*** – Context-aware AWAC and Fake RTC
* ***SSDT-EC*** – OS-aware fake EC for Desktops and Laptops
* ***SSDT-PLUG*** – Sets plugin-type to `1` on `CPU0`/`PR00`
* ***SSDT-HPET*** – Patches out IRQ Conflicts
* ***SSDT-PMC*** – Enables Native NVRAM on true 300-Series Boards and newer
* ***SSDT-USB-Reset*** – Resets USB controllers to allow hardware mapping

**NOTE**: When used in Windows, SSDTTime also can dump the `DSDT`.

**HOW TO:**

1. Download [**SSDTTime**](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime) and run it
2. Pres "D", drag in your system's DSDT and hit "ENTER"
3. Generate all the SSDTs you need.
4. The SSDTs will be stored under `Results` inside the `SSDTTime-master` Folder along with `patches_OC.plist`.
5. Copy the generated `SSDTs` to EFI/OC/ACPI
6. Open `patches_OC.plist` and copy the included patches and files listed under "ACPI > Add" to your `config.plist` (to the same section, of course).
7. Save. Reboot. Done.

## Patching method 2: manual

### Example 1
- In `DSDT`, search for `Processor`, e.g.:

	```	swift 
      Scope (_PR)
      {
          Processor (CPU0, 0x01, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU1, 0x02, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU2, 0x03, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU3, 0x04, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU4, 0x05, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU5, 0x06, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU6, 0x07, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (CPU7, 0x08, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
      }
	```
- Based on the search result, the `Processor` object is located in the Scope `_PR` and the name of the first core is `CPU0`, so select the injection file: ***SSDT-PLUG-_PR.CPU0***

### Example 2
- In `DSDT`, search for `Processor`, e.g.:

	```swift
      Scope (_SB)
      {
          Processor (PR00, 0x01, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR01, 0x02, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR02, 0x03, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR03, 0x04, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR04, 0x05, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR05, 0x06, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR06, 0x07, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR07, 0x08, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR08, 0x09, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR09, 0x0A, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR10, 0x0B, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR11, 0x0C, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR12, 0x0D, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR13, 0x0E, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR14, 0x0F, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
          Processor (PR15, 0x10, 0x00001810, 0x06){}
      }
	```
- Based on the search result, the `Processor` object is located under `_SB` and the name of the first core is `PR00`, so select the injection file: ***SSDT-PLUG-_SB.CPU0***

**IMPORTANT**: If the query result and the patch file name **do not match**, please select any file as a sample and modify the patch file related content by yourself. If you are unsure what to do, use the `SSDT-PLUG.aml` sample included with the OpenCore package since it covers all cases of possible CPU device names.

## Testing
To check if Speedstep and turbo work correctly, run Intel Power Gadget and monitor the frequency curve while running a CPU benchmark test in Geekbench. The CPU frequency range should reach all the way from the lowest possible frequency (before running the test) up to the max turbo frequency as defined by the product specs.

Additionally, you could use [**CPUFriendFriend**](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend) to inject modified frequency vectors into macOS to fine tune its performance.

## Notes and Credits
- The `X86PlatformPlugin` is not available for 2nd Gen (Sandy Bridge) and 3rd Gen (Ivy Bridge) Intel CPUs - they use the `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` instead. But you can use [**ssdtPPRGen**](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh) to generate a `SSDT-PM` for these CPUs instead to enable proper CPU Power Management.
- Dortania for `SSDT-CPUR.aml` 
- For Intel Xeon CPUs, a different approach is required if the CPU is not detected by macOS. See [**this guide**](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/349526-cpu-wrapping-ssdt-cpu-wrap-ssdt-cpur-acpi0007/) for reference.
- > With macOS 12.3 Beta 1, Apple dropped the 'plugin-type' check within `X86PlatformPlugin`. Because of this, X86PP will match onto the CPU instead of ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin. This causes power management to break on pre-Ivy Bridge CPUs as they don't have correct power management tables provided. More info [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/2013).
