## Background
Although the `XHCIPortLimit` Quirk which lifts the USB port count limit from 15 to 26 ports per USB controller under macOS was fixed in OpenCore 0.9.3, it is recommended to only enable it temporarily for creating a custom USB port injector kext with tools like `Hackintool` or `USBMap`: 

> While [using `XHCIPortLimit`] sounds like the best-case solution, it does come with some drawbacks… The port limit is *hardcoded* in a ton of places all over OS, and as we're only lifting it in a few, this causes access outside the bounds of a fixed array. We're accessing things that shouldn't even be there, and that can cause some odd or unpredictable side effects.[…] Ultimately, it's considered best practice to only leverage the port limit patch for the mapping process, and then to disable it.

Since USB port injector kexts are usually bound to the SMBIOS, the best and cleanest way to declare USB ports is via ACPI, since this method works independent of the macOS version and SMBIOS!

## Benefits of mapping USB ports via ACPI vs. using a USB port kext 

1. **Universal**: The port mapping is OS-agnostic and independent of the selected SMBIOS
2. **Stability**: ACPI mappings are generally more stable across macOS updates.
3. **Customization**: ACPI allows for more granular control over individual ports.
4. **Compatibility**: ACPI method works with a wider range of USB controllers.
5. **Performance**: Potentially better performance as it's closer to how Apple implements USB mapping.
6. **Easier maintenance**: ACPI can be easier to maintain long-term compared to kexts.
7. **Security**: Less likely to be affected by security changes in macOS that might impact kexts.

## Approach
In order to build our own USB port map as SSDT, we will do the following:

1. Dump the original ACPI tables from BIOS
2. Find the SSDT which declares USB ports
3. Modify it so 15 ports are mapped for macOS without affecting other OSes
4. Inject this SSDT during boot, replacing the original one

The method presented here is a slightly modified version of a guide by "Apfelnico" and "N0b0dy" of the [**German Hackintosh Forum**](https://www.hackintosh-forum.de/forum/thread/54986-usb-mittels-ssdt-deklarieren/?postID=721415) which I used to create my own `SSDT-PORTS.aml`. I just translated and transformed it into this step by step guide. 

## Patching requirments
In order to declare USB ports via ACPI, 2 conditions of the ACPI tables in your system have to be met:

1. The USB ports are declared in a separate `SSDT`, not inside the `DSDT` itself!
2. This SSDT contains an `XHC` device as well as the method `_UPC` and a list of ports, primarily `HSxx` and `SSxx` (xx = integers, e.g. `HS01` and/or `SS01`, etc.)

> [!WARNING]
>
> This method is not applicable on systems where `_UPC` is defined in the `DSDT`!

## Preparations

### Required Tools
- [**Clover Bootmanager**](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases) for dumping your system's ACPI tables.
- [**maciASL**](https://github.com/acidanthera/MaciASL) or [**XIASL**](https://github.com/ic005k/Xiasl/releases) (cross-platform) for editing `.dsl`/`.aml` files.
- [**IOResgistryExplorer**](https://github.com/utopia-team/IORegistryExplorer/releases) for gathering infos about I/O on macOS. Used for probing USB Ports.
- [**OpenCore Auxiliary Tools**](https://github.com/ic005k/QtOpenCoreConfig) or a Plist Editor for editing the `config.plist`.
- [**Example Files**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/03_USB_Fixes/ACPI_Mapping_USB_Ports/Example_Files) (for following along)
- FAT32 formatted USB 3.x flash drive for dumping ACPI tables and probing `SS` ports.
- Additional USB 2.0 flash drive (optional, for probing `HS` ports).
- Your mainboard manual with a schematic of the physical locations of the USB headers and ports.
- Spreadsheet for taking notes about Port names, Types and physical Location (optional).
- Patience and time (mandatory). Seriously, this is not for beginners! 

### Dumping ACPI Tables
There are various ways to dump ACPI Tables from your BIOS: 

- Using **Clover** (easiest method): Hit `F4` in the Boot Menu. You don't even need a working configuration to do this. Just download the latest [**Release**](https://github.com/CloverHackyColor/CloverBootloader/releases) as a `.zip` file, extract it, put it on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive and boot from it. The dumped ACPI Tables will be located in: `EFI\CLOVER\ACPI\origin`
- Using **OpenCore** (requires the Debug version and a working config): enable Misc > Debug > `SysReport` Quirk. The ACPI Tables will be dumped during next boot.

## Finding and dropping the original USB port table
### Intel Skylake and newer CPUs
Have a look into Clover's "ACPI/origin" folder. In there you will find a lot of ACPI tables. We are interested in **SSDT-xxxx.aml** files. Find the one which includes code like this:

![SSDT_og](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520366-c3c75933-ab97-4d60-b627-cc4673e4b643.png)

**We can see the following**:

- The SSDT contains an `XHC` (eXtensible Host Controller) device and an `XHC.RHUB` (USB Root Hub) device
- There's a list of Ports, 26 in this case: `HS01` to `HS14`, `USR1` and `USR2`, and `SS01` to `SS10`. We will come back to the meaning of these names later. 

> [!TIP]
> 
> Take note of the "Table Signature" and the "OEM Table ID". We will need them later to create a drop rule in the `ACPI/Delete` section of the OpenCore config, so it can be replaced by our modified table we are going to create.

### Intel Broadwell and older CPUs
ACPI tables for Broadwell and older Intel CPUs don't use separate SSDTs for mapping USB ports – it's all handled within the `DSDT` itself so you can't drop this table. The `DSDT` includes Controllers for USB 2 (`EHC0`, `EHC1`, etc.) and USB 3 (`XHCI`). In most cases, you don't have to manually map these ports since each controller usually contains less than 15 Ports as you can see in this example from an Ivy Bridge Notebook:

|Device Tree | Explanation
------------|------------
![legacyports](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/163591806-b34aebd2-7d41-47ce-bc80-054447cf1e64.png) | <ul> <li> OEM USB port mapping example from an Ivy Bridge Notebook <li> This system has 3 USB controllers: <ul> <li> `XHCI` (USB 3), <li> `EHC1` (USB 2) and <li>`EHC2` (USB 2) </ul> <li> The `XHCI` device only contains 8 Ports: `HPS0` to `HSP3` and `SSP0` to `SSP3`. <li> The `EHC1` device also contains 8 ports:  (`PRT0` to `PRT7`). <li> `EHC2` only contains 6 ports: `PRT8` to `PRTD`. </ul> &rarr; Since the 15 port limit is *per* controller and since each of the controllers have less than 15 ports mapped, we don't need to do any port remapping here.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Just because an SSDT includes 26 port *entries*, it doesn't meant that they are all connected to physical devices on the mainboard. Look at it more as a template used by developers.
> - If your system has issues with sleep and wake due to an *internally* connected WiFi/Bluetooth/Camera module not being detected as "internal", I suggest you check in Windows which USB port the device uses. In device manager, find the device and open it's preferences. Click the tab "Details". From the "Property" dropdown menu, select "BIOS pathname" (or similar). This will show the ACPI path of the port the device is connected to. Since Bluetooth uses USB 2.0, it will most likely be a `HSxx` port. Take note of the port and change it's type to `FF` (255) in the SSDT later.
> - Alternatively, use [**USBToolBox**](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool) under Windows to create a USBPort kext and change the port type for the the port in question to `255`. This should fix the problem.

### Adding a delete rule to config.plist
In order to delete (or drop) the original table during boot and replace it with our own, we need to tell OpenCore to look for the Signature ("SSDT") and the OEM Table ID (in my case "xh_cmsd4") to drop.

**CAUTION**: Don't use my value for the OEM Table ID, since yours probably has a different name!

1. Open your `config.plist` (I am using OpenCore Auxiliary Tools)
2. Go to ACPI > Delete and add a new Rule (click on "+")
3. In `TableSignature`, enter `53534454` which is HEX for `SSDT`:</br>
	![TableSig](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520564-10b44f45-778b-47ad-a3ae-318ce9334aac.png)
4. In `OemTableID`, enter the name of the "OEM Table ID" (See first screenshot) stored in YOUR (NOT mine, YOUR!) SSDT-Whatever.aml without `""` as a HEX value. In OCAT, you can use ASCI to Hex converter at the bottom of the app:</br>
	![OEMTableID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520641-97a42e24-175b-4e3a-badb-23b57fa31ac8.png)
5. Enable the rule and a comment so you know what it does.
6. Save the config.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - In some cases, the `TableLength` may be required as well to drop the table successfully.
> - If the USB ports are defined within the `DSDT` itself, you cannot use this approach and have to find other ways of manipulating the values in the DSDT directly by utilizing using ACPI renames, [as explained here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/352311-mapping-usb-ports-discussions/?do=findComment&comment=2790643).

You should have the correct rule for replacing the ACPI Table containing the USB Port declarations. Let's move on to the hard part…

## Preparing the replacement SSDT
Now that we have found the SSDT with the original USB port declarations, we can start modifying them. Almost. We still need more details, though…

### Modifying the original USB Table
Two methods are relevant for declaring USB ports: `_UPC` and `_PLD`. Both methods handle their values over to `GUPC` and `GPLD` inside the Root Hub (`RHUB`).
 
#### 1. `_UPC` ([**USB Port Capabilities**](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/09_ACPI_Defined_Devices_and_Device_Specific_Objects.html?highlight=upc#upc-usb-port-capabilities))

`_UPC` defines the type of port and it's state (enabled/disabled). Its structure looks as follows:

```asl
_UPC, Package ()
{
    xxxx,
    yyyy,
    0x00,
    0x00
}
```
##### Explanations

1. **`xxxx`**
   - `0x00` means the port does not exist
   - Other values (usually `0x0F`) mean that the port exists and is enabled

2. **`yyyy`** defines the type of the port. The following USB Port Types can be declared (we will come back to this later):

   | **`yyyy`** | Port Type |
   | :------: | ----------------------------- |
   | `0X00` | USB Type `A` |
   | `0x01` | USB `Mini-AB` |
   | `0x02` | USB Smart Card |
   | `0x03` | USB 3 Standard Type `A` |
   | `0x04` | USB 3 Standard Type `B` |
   | `0x05` | USB 3 `Micro-B` |
   | `0x06` | USB 3 `Micro-AB` |
   | `0x07` | USB 3 `Power-B` |
   | `0x08` | USB Type `C` **(USB 2 only)** |
   | `0x09` | USB Type `C` **(with switch)** | 
   | `0x0A` | USB Type `C` **(w/o switch)** | 
   | `0xFF` | Built-in |

**UBS-C Switches**: if both sides of a USB-C connector are plugged into the same physical port and hackintool uses the same port for it, than the connected device has a switch. In other words: 2 sides, 1 port = switch. Conversely, if both sides of the same connector occupy two ports, it has no switch

#### 2. `_PLD` ([**Physical Location of Device**](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/06_Device_Configuration.html#pld-physical-location-of-device))

Defines the location of the physical port and its properties (not covered by this guide)

#### Adding `Arg1` to `GUPC`
First, take a look at the routine `GUPC` inside of the `RHUB`:

![GUPC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520755-8406844d-b16a-4f58-8e84-95e5122d5c06.png)
	
In this case, it includes a Package (`PCKG`) with four values that are handed over to every USB port in the method `_UPC`. But as is, we currently only have control over the first value of the package (via `Arg0`), which describes the availability of the port. But we also need control over the 2nd value in the package which declares the USB port type or personality. Therefore, we need to modify the method `GUPC`:

- In the Header, we change the `GUPC, 1,` to `GUPC, 2,` (since we want to control 2 values of this package)
- Next, we add `PCKG [One] = Arg1`, so it hands over the 2nd package value to `_UPC` as well.
- In this package, we change the first value to `0xFF` to set the port "enabled" 
- Finally, we set the second package to `0x03`, which changes the port type to USB 2.0 and 3.0 with a Type A connector (the blue ones).

Now we have control over a port's status (on/off or available/unavailable) and what type it is. As a result, we get the following code snippet:

```asl
Method (GUPC, 2, Serialized)
{
	Name (PCKG, Package (0x04)
	{
        	0xFF,
        	0x03,
        	Zero, 
    		Zero
   	})
	PCKG [Zero] = Arg0
	PCKG [One] = Arg1
	Return (PCKG) /* \GUPC.PCKG */
}
```
`Arg0`= addresses the first value in the package. It enables (`0xff`) or disables (`Zero`) the port</br>
`Arg1`= addresses the second value in the package. It declares the USB port type as mentioned earlier (`0x00` for USB2, `0x03` for USB, etc.)

#### Deleting the existing `_UPC` method
After changing these values, you will get a lot of compiler errors:

![GUPC_errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520833-8f5ae018-aa7e-4e34-8b2f-73f0c8061d1a.png)

That's because the 2nd variable (`Arg1`) is not part of the corresponding method `_UPC` in each of the USB Port entries:

![_UPC_errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520865-0c51e4a2-a905-42f8-8805-f00c3276e98a.png)

To fix this, we will delete the methods `_UPC` from all the Ports. Select the method…

![Highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137520903-86832ac4-e60f-413b-84c5-e23887833897.png)

…and hit delete. The method should be gone from the table:

![Deleted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521280-012baf78-2d94-4be2-ba5e-c0aafc679e3b.png)

Repeat this step 23 more times. For `USR1` and `USR2` we can set `GUPC` to `(Zero, Zero)`, since macOS doesn't support them:

![USR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521318-60b2a97f-8e7a-4489-80cb-fa040631a947.png)

Once all `_UPC` methods are deleted from the rest of the ports, there should be no more compiler errors:

![No_errors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521582-8b901345-ade2-47eb-9388-321b7cc46df1.png)

#### Adding the new `_UPC` method

Next, we hav to add the new`_UPC` method to each port (except for `USR1` and `USR2`):

```asl
Method (_UPC, 0, NotSerialized)  // _UPC: USB Port Capabilities
	{
		Return (GUPC (0xFF, 0x03))
	}
```
Which looks like this:

![New_UPC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521717-b747a017-f9d1-4189-a6cd-0e77a7475d9d.png)

Now we have a USB Port SSDT Template with 24 enabled ports defined as USB 2.0/USB 3.0 Type A. Let's save it as `SSDT-PORTS_start.aml`. But we are not done yet, sorry.

## Mapping the ports (finally)
Next, we need to figure out how the ports are attached to actually physical USB connectors.

### How USB is structured in ACPI
When it comes to USB, there is a Root Hub (`RHUB`) which contains the defined USB ports. But a port can also function as Hub itself (Integrated Hub), as you can see in this illustration:

![ACPIdefined_Devices_and_DeviceSpecificObjects-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/191863871-53de2612-590e-471f-8a8b-85f20f82ec63.png)

This is an example of port characteristics object implemented for a USB host controller’s root hub where:

- Three Ports are implemented; Port 1 is not user visible/not connectable and Ports 2 and 3 are user visible and connectable.
- Port 2 is located on the back panel
- Port 3 has an integrated 2 port hub. Note that because this port hosts an integrated hub, it is therefore not sharable with another host controller (e.g. If the integrated hub is a USB2.0 hub, the port can never be shared with a USB1.1 companion controller). The ports available through the embedded hub are located on the front panel and are adjacent to one another.

**SOURCE**: [UEFI.org](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/09_ACPI-Defined_Devices_and_Device-Specific_Objects/ACPIdefined_Devices_and_DeviceSpecificObjects.html#upc-usb-port-capabilities)

### USB Port Types
According to the ACPI Specifications about [USB Port Capabilities](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/09_ACPI_Defined_Devices_and_Device_Specific_Objects.html#upc-return-package-values), the USB Types are declared by different bytes. Here are some common ones found on current mainboards:

| Type   | Info                           | Comment |
|:------:|--------------------------------|---------|
|**0x00**| Type-A connector, USB 2.0 only | This is what macOS will default all ports to when no map is present. The physical connector is usually colored black|
|**0x03**| Type-A connector, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 combined | USB 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2 ports share the same Type. Usually colored blue (USB 2.0/3.0) or red (USB 3.2)|
|**0x08**| Type C connector, USB 2.0 only | Mainly used in phones|
|**0x09**| Type C connector, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 with Switch | Flipping the device does not change the ACPI port |
|**0x0A**| Type C connector, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 w/o Switch |Flipping the device does change the ACPI port. generally seen on USB 3.1/3.2 mainboard headers|
|**0xFF**| Proprietary Connector | For internal USB 2.0 connections like Bluetooth or integrated cameras |

We will use these "Type" bytes to declare the USB Port types.

### USB Port Names
As seen earlier, the ports listed in the SSDT have different names.

| Name          | Description            | Protocol          | Speed            |
|:-------------:|------------------------|:------------------|-----------------:|
| **HS01…HS14** | HS = High Speed Ports  | USB 2.0 only      | 480 mbit/s       |
| **SS01…SS10** | SS = Super Speed Ports | USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 | 5 to 20 Gbit/s   |
| **USR1/2**    | Not supported by macOS. Deactivate them.   | Intel AMT        | 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A physical USB 3.0 Connector (the blue one) actually connects to two USB Ports: one for USB 2.0 and one for USB 3.0. So having 15 Ports available for mapping doesn't mean that you can assign them to 15 physical connectors. Actually, you can only assign them to 7 USB 3.x and 1 USB 2.0-only connectors.

**EXAMPLE**: if you plug in a USB 3.0 flash drive, you can see in IORegistryExplorer, that it connects to `SS07` for example. If you take it out and put a USB 2.0 drive in the same connector, it will most likely be connected to `HS07` now. So 1 Connector, 2 Ports with the same counter (usually) – in this example HS07 and SS07.

### Port mapping options
At this stage, there are two options for mapping your USB ports.

- Option A: you already know which ports connect to which physical connectors.
- Option B: you don't know which Ports connect to which physical connector so you need to probe them.

#### Option A: Mapping ports based on a known configuration
This is for people who already created a `USBPorts.kext` in Hackintool or similar and still have the mapping. In my case, I have a Spreadsheet, which looks like this:

![Ports_List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521950-e354ec4f-aa9c-4a4e-a146-7d9204387c80.png)
	
As you can see, `HS01` is not used in my case, so we deactivate it. But to keep compatibility with other Operating Systems, we turn it off for macOS only. To achieve this, we use a conditional rule with an "if/else" statement, the method `_OSI` (Operating System Interfaces): `If (_OSI ("Darwin"))`. It tells the system: "If the Darwin Kernel (aka macOS) is loaded, `HS01` does not exist, everybody else can have it". This is a super elegant and non-invasive way of declaring USB Ports without messing up the port mapping for other OSes. This is the code snippet (adjust the scope accordingly):

![darwin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/137521985-96a3620d-b6b3-40ee-b554-ce86078b05d7.png)

This is the Code snippet. As you can see, it is applies to `_UPC` and `_PLD` in this case

```asl
Scope (\_SB.PCI0.XHC.RHUB.HS01)
{
	Method (_UPC, 0, NotSerialized)  // _UPC: USB Port Capabilities
	{
		If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
		{	
			Return (GUPC (Zero, Zero)) // ZERO = Port unavailable
		}
     		Else
		{
			Return (GUPC (0xFF, 0x03))
     		}
 	}
 	Method (_PLD, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PLD: Physical Location of Device
   	{
   		If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
   		{
			Return (GPLD (Zero, Zero)) // ZERO = Port unavailable
		}    
		Else
		{
			Return // For `Else`, use whatever is already declared in your ACPI for `GPLD`
  		}
	}   
```
**Example 3**: Port `HS03` deactivated for macOS Only. This utilizes the `If (_OSI ("Darwin"))` switch. This basically tells the system: "If the Darwin Kernel (aka macOS) is running, `HS03` does not exist, everybody else can have it". This is a super elegant and non-invasive way of declaring USB Ports without messing up the port mapping for Windows.

```asl
Scope (HS03)
{
	Method (_UPC, 0, NotSerialized)  // _UPC: USB Port Capabilities
  	{
   		If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
		{
      			Return (GUPC (Zero, Zero)) // If macOS is running, HS03 doesn't exist, for every other OS it does
		}
		Else
		{
       			Return (GUPC (0xFF, 0x03))
		}
  	}
	Method (_PLD, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PLD: Physical Location of Device
	{
		If (_OSI ("Darwin"))
		{
			Return (GPLD (Zero, Zero)) // If macOS is running, HS03 doesn't exist, for every other OS it does
		}

Continue mapping your ports this way: for those which you do use, declare the port type in the packets. For those that you don't use, deactivate them but add an `If (_OSI ("Darwin"))` argument (as shown above). 

**Remember**: This SSDT contains 26 ports in total, so you need to deactivate at least 11 in total to stay within the Port limit of 15 for macOS!

Once you reach `USR1` and `USR2`, change `GUPC` to `Zero`, `Zero`. This to deactivates them (if you need these port in Windows, add the `If (_OSI ("Darwin"))` switch).

```asl
Scope (USR1)
{
	Method (_UPC, 0, NotSerialized)	// _UPC: USB Port Capabilities
	{
   		Return (GUPC (Zero, Zero)	// Zero, Zero = Port disabled, Type not defined
   	}
	
	Method (_PLD, 0, NotSerialized)	// _PLD: Physical Location of Device
	{
		Return (GPLD (Zero, Zero))
   	}
}
```
#### Option B: Mapping Ports of an unknown configuration
Option B is for user who don't already know which internal USB ports connect to which physical port on the front and back I/O panel of their computer or internally. Basically, this works the same as Option A. The only difference is that you need to find out which physical port connects to which internal USB port of your machine.

##### Gathering information about USB Ports
The first step is to monitor the Ports, while connecting USB 2 and USB 3 Sticks to them. Take notes of which physical USB port connect to which port internally. You can monitor the Ports use IORegistryExplorer for this too, but [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool) or Corpnewt's [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap) are a lot simpler to use:

- Run the python script `USBMap.command` 
- Press "d" on the Keyboard to detect ports:</br>
![USBmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/142078666-1a96ee4e-dc82-4658-91d6-ac370614b2a8.png)</br>
In this example, the system has more than one USB Controller. For the sake of the Example, we focus on the ports declared in the `XHC` Controller ("HSXX" and "SSXX").
- Leave the Window open and put in your USB 2 Stick into a port and check which entry turns blue in the list and take notes.
- Next, put a USB 3.0 stick in the same port and see what turns blue next. Usually, if a physical USB port is blue, it supports USB 2 and 3 Ports. An as far as its routing is concerned, only the Prefix changes when switching between USB 2 and USB3. In other words: if a USB 2 stick is mapped to "HS01", the corresponding USB 3 Port will most likely be "SS01".
- Continue probing all ports with USB 2/3/C flash drives or devices und you're done.
- Once you collected all the necessary data return to "Option A" of the guide to map the ports in ACPI.

### Assigning Physical Location of Device (`_PLD`) 
This method provides a lot of details about the physical location of the USB ports themselves. Such as: location, shape, color and a lot of rather uninteresting details for PC users. Here's a long list of some of the available parameters:

```asl
Name (_PLD, Package (0x01)  // _PLD: Physical Location of Device
{
    ToPLD (
        PLD_Revision           = 0x1,
        PLD_IgnoreColor        = 0x1,
        PLD_Red                = 0x0,
        PLD_Green              = 0x0,
        PLD_Blue               = 0x0,
        PLD_Width              = 0x0,
        PLD_Height             = 0x0,
        PLD_UserVisible        = 0x1,
        PLD_Dock               = 0x0,
        PLD_Lid                = 0x0,
        PLD_Panel              = "UNKNOWN",
        PLD_VerticalPosition   = "UPPER",
        PLD_HorizontalPosition = "LEFT",
        PLD_Shape              = "UNKNOWN",
        PLD_GroupOrientation   = 0x0,
        PLD_GroupToken         = 0x0,
        PLD_GroupPosition      = 0x0,
        PLD_Bay                = 0x0,
        PLD_Ejectable          = 0x0,
        PLD_EjectRequired      = 0x0,
        PLD_CabinetNumber      = 0x0,
        PLD_CardCageNumber     = 0x0,
        PLD_Reference          = 0x0,
        PLD_Rotation           = 0x0,
        PLD_Order              = 0x0,
        PLD_VerticalOffset     = 0x0,
        PLD_HorizontalOffset   = 0x0)
})
```
Among all these rather unnecessary properties, "Ejectable" might be useable. You want to make sure that internally connected USB ports, for Bluetooth for example are not ejectable. Otherwise you have to power cycle (aka reboot) your system to enable it again. Since modifying `_PLD` won't be covered in this guide, please refer to to the ACPI specifications for [**`_PLD`**](https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.4/06_Device_Configuration/Device_Configuration.html#pld-physical-location-of-device)

## Wrapping up and testing
Once you are done with your port mapping activities, do the following:

- Save the SSDT as something plausible like `SSDT-XHCI.aml` or `SSDT-PORTS.aml` (keep it short!)
- Mount your EFI partition
- Copy the EFI folder to a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive (for testing)
- Add the .aml file to the `EFI\OC\ACPI` folder on your flash driver.
- Open your OpenCore `config.plist` (the one on the flash drive)
- Add the file to the `ACPI > Add` Section and enable it.
- Make sure to enable the rule to drop the OEM USB table in the `ACPI > Delete` section.
- Save the `config.plist`
- Reboot from USB flash drive. 
- Test the ports with macOS and your other Operating systems.
- If it works, Congrats! 
- Copy the .aml and your config.plist back to the EFI folder on the hard disk.

**Good Luck!**
