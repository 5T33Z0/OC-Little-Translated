# Generating an OpenCore Config with OpCore Simplify

## About

I recently stumbled over an interesting project on Github called [**OpCore Simplify**](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify). It's designed to automate and streamline the creation of OpenCore EFI configurations for Hackintosh setups. It supports a wide range of hardware, including modern CPUs and GPUs, and macOS versions from High Sierra to Sequoia. 

In terms of building an OpenCore config semi-automatically, OpCore Simplify the first tool of its kind. Although you can run it under macOS, in my experience it best works under Microsoft Windows.

**How It Works:**

1. **Hardware Detection:** OpCore Simplify automatically detects your system's hardware components, such as CPU, GPU, chipset, NICs, peripherals, etc. This information is crucial for generating a compatible EFI configuration.

2. **ACPI Patches and Kexts:** Based on the detected hardware, the tool applies necessary ACPI patches and includes appropriate kernel extensions (kexts) to ensure compatibility and functionality. It integrates with SSDTTime for common patches and includes custom patches to prevent kernel panics and disable unsupported devices. 

3. **SMBIOS Configuration:** The tool generates a suitable System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) configuration tailored to your hardware, which is essential for macOS compatibility.

4. **EFI Folder Generation:** After gathering all necessary files and configurations, OpCore Simplify creates an OpenCore EFI folder customized for your system. This folder includes the bootloader, configuration files, ACPI patches, and kexts required for macOS installation.

5. **User Guidance:** The tool provides instructions on additional steps, such as USB mapping using USBToolBox and adding the generated USBMap.kext to your EFI, to ensure a fully functional Hackintosh setup.

## Usage Example

I've tried OpCore Simplify on one my Ivy Bridge laptop which requires quite a complex configuration to boot macOS 13 and newer. Below, I've explained how I did, so you can check out for yourself if you wanr to try it
how you can use it.

1. Run MS Windows
2. Download [**OpCore Simplify**](https://github.com/lzhoang2801/OpCore-Simplify) (click on `<> Code` and select "Download Zip")
3. Extract the zip file
4. Run the `OpCore-Simplify.bat` file (click on "More info", if Windows wants to block the script)
5. This will start a Terminal Window and download required files. Once that's done, you will be greeted by the following screen:<br>![main](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/01.png)
6. Select option <kbd>1</kbd> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
7. This will start the hardware detection â€“ Type <kbd>e</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:<br>![detect](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/02.png)
8. Once the hardware detection is completed, a report is shown:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/03.png)
9. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the main screen:<br>![main](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/04.png)
10. Select option <kbd>2</kbd> and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
11. Select the macOS version you want to install by entering the corresponding number, here <kbd>24</kbd> for macOS Sequoia:<br>![macOS](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/05.png)
12. Back in the main screen, select Option <kbd>3</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:<br>![select macOS](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/07.png)
13. This shows the available SSDT hotfixes availabe for your system:<br>![SSDTs](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/09.png)
14. Select/de-select the SSDTs you need for your system. Most required patches will be pre-enabled automatically. If you are uncertain which ones you need (or not), please refer to the [**OpenCore Install Guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/). Once your done reviewing the SSDTs, type <kbd>b</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the main menu.
15. Back in the main screen, select Option <kbd>4</kbd> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select/modify the kexts to add to your OpenCore EFI folder:<br>![kexts](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/11.png)
16. Return to the main screen and select Option <kbd>5</kbd> and press enter to select an SMBIOS best matching your CPU, here it's `MacBookPro10,1`, since my Laptop has an i7 Ivy Bridge Mobile CPU:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/12.png)
17. Return to the main screen and select option <kbd>6</kbd> to start building the OpenCore EFI folder and `config.plist`. Once that's done you will be notified about the next steps to map USB ports:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/13.png)
18. [**Map your USB ports**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/03_USB_Fixes) as explained and add the required kext(s) to the `EFI/OC/Kexts` folder located under:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/14.png)
19. Open your `config.plist` with [**ProperTree**](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and creat an OC Snapshot:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/OpCore_Simplify/15.png)

## Testing
### If macOS is installed already 
- Put your newly generated EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive and try to boot macOS with it.
- If it works out of the box, congrats! If it doesn't work consult the [**OpenCore Troubleshooting Guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html). 

### If macOS is not installed
- If macOS is not installed alread, you can follow this guide to [**create a USB Installer**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/#making-the-installer) and put your EFI folder on it.
- Restart your system from the USB flash drive and [**install macOS**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#installation-process). Windows users can also use [**UnPlugged**](https://github.com/corpnewt/UnPlugged).
- For troubleshooting, consult the [**OpenCore Troubleshooting Guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html).

## Closing thoughts
In this example, this particular system didn't boot with the generated EFI and config. But I've tried OpCore Simplify on two newer systems and it worked out of the box. Still, I think OpCore Simplify is the closest thing to a fully automated OpenCore configuration tool we have yet. It's a great tool for new and inexperienced users who simply want to try OpenCore without spending hours trying to configure OpenCore and the EFI folder. I am very excited to see future developments.
