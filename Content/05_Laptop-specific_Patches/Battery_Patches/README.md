# Fixing the battery status indicator on Laptops

## Try `ECEnabler.kext` first!
Before applying any of these battery patches available here, you should test the new [**ECEnabler.kext**](https://github.com/1Revenger1/ECEnabler) first, which "allows reading Embedded Controller fields over 1 byte long, vastly reducing the amount of ACPI modification needed (if any) for working battery status". It works on a lot of ThinkPads and other Laptops without additional ACPI patches and Battery SSDTs.
