## Description

When a conflict between **AppleRTC** and **BIOS** occurs, use [**RTCMemoryFixup.kext**](https://github.com/acidanthera/RTCMemoryFixup) to emulate **CMOS** memory to fix it.

## About **CMOS** Memory

- **CMOS** memory holds important data such as date, time, hardware configuration information, auxiliary setup information, boot settings, hibernation information, etc.

- Some **CMOS** memory space definitions are:
  - Date, time, hardware configuration: `00-0D` 
  - Hibernation information storage interval: `80-AB` 
  - Power management: `B0-B4` 
  - Other

## View CMOS memory

- Add ***RtcRw.efi*** (included in the OpenCore package) to `EFI\OC\Tools` and your config.plist 
- Add ***OpenShell.efi*** as well
- Save and reboot
- Run the Shell from the BootPicker
- Go to the directory tools
- Type `rtcrw read XX` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Where XX is the CMOS memory address. For example, `rtcrw read 08` can view the current month. If this month is May, check the result as 0x05 (BCD code).

## Emulating **CMOS** memory

- Install **RTCMemoryFixup** to `OC\Kexts` 
- Add it to the list of `UEFI/Drivers` in the config.plist.
- Add `rtcfx_exclude=â€¦` to **`boot-args`**.

**Examples**: 

- `rtcfx_exclude=0D`, 
- `rtcfx_exclude=40-AF`, 
- `rtcfx_exclude=2A,2D,80-AB`, etc.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Emulating **CMOS** memory will erase the originally defined functions, please **use with caution**. For example: `rtcfx_exclude=00-0D` will cause the date and time of the machine to stop updating during sleep.
