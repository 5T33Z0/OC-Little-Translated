# Guide: Enabling `AppleVTD`

## Overview
**AppleVTD** is macOS’s implementation of Intel’s VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O), enabling direct memory access (DMA) for specific hardware features. Enabling AppleVTD is often necessary for:

- **GPU Passthrough**: Passing a GPU to a virtual machine (e.g., QEMU/KVM or VMware for macOS or other OSes).
- **Thunderbolt/USB Hotplug**: Enhancing support for Thunderbolt devices or USB hotplug functionality.
- **Networking**: Supporting modern NICs (2.5 Gbps+) and WiFi cards, such as Intel I225-V on Gigabyte boards or third-party cards (e.g., Fenvi, Aquantia), which rely on DMA.

This guide outlines the prerequisites, steps to enable AppleVTD, and the optional use of SSDT-DMAC to address potential issues.

## Prerequisites
To enable AppleVTD, ensure the following conditions are met:

1. **Hardware Support**:
   - Your CPU and chipset must support Intel VT-d (most Intel Core i5/i7 CPUs from 2nd generation onward).
   - Verify VT-d compatibility in your motherboard’s manual or CPU specification.
2. **BIOS Configuration**:
   - Enable **VT-d** or **IOMMU** in the BIOS/UEFI settings.
3. **OpenCore Bootloader**:
   - Use OpenCore for ACPI table modifications and kernel quirks configuration.
4. **Tools for Verification**:
   - Install **IORegistryExplorer** or **Hackintool** to check for `AppleVTD` in the IO Registry after configuration.

## Steps to Enable AppleVTD
Follow these steps to configure your Hackintosh for AppleVTD:

1. **Enable VT-d in BIOS**:
   - Access your motherboard’s BIOS/UEFI.
   - Locate and enable **Intel VT-d** or **IOMMU** (exact naming varies by manufacturer).
   - Save changes and reboot.

2. **Configure OpenCore Kernel Quirk**:
   - In your OpenCore `config.plist`, navigate to `Kernel > Quirks`.
   - Set `DisableIoMapper` to `false` (unchecked) to allow AppleVTD to initialize.

3. **Drop the OEM DMAR Table**:
   - The OEM DMAR (DMA Remapping) table may include reserved memory regions that conflict with AppleVTD.
   - In OpenCore `config.plist`, under `ACPI > Delete`:
     - Add an entry to drop the `DMAR` table.
     - Reference: [Dropping the DMAR Table](/Content/00_ACPI/ACPI_Dropping_Tables#example-1-dropping-the-dmar-table).

4. **Inject a Modified DMAR Table**:
   - Create or obtain a modified DMAR table without reserved memory regions.
   - Add the modified DMAR table to OpenCore under `ACPI > Add`.
   - Reference: [Replacing the DMAR Table](/Content/00_ACPI/ACPI_Dropping_Tables#example-2-replacing-the-dmar-table-by-a-modified-one).

5. **Verify AppleVTD Activation**:
   - Boot into macOS.
   - Open **IORegistryExplorer** and search for `AppleVTD` in the IO Registry.
   - If present, AppleVTD is active, and no further action is needed.
   - Example of successful activation:

## Optional: Using SSDT-DMAC
If `AppleVTD` is not present in the IO Registry after completing the above steps, your system may lack a DMAC (DMA Controller) definition in its ACPI tables. The **SSDT-DMAC** can address this issue.

### Role of SSDT-DMAC
- **Purpose**: SSDT-DMAC injects a fake DMAC device into the ACPI tables, which macOS may expect for AppleVTD initialization.
- **Cosmetic Nature**: In most cases, AppleVTD works without SSDT-DMAC. However, some motherboards (e.g., older Intel chipsets or Gigabyte boards) require this fake device to ensure macOS can access all memory regions for AppleVTD.
- **Limitations**: SSDT-DMAC does not directly enable AppleVTD or interact with physical hardware. It only satisfies macOS’s ACPI requirements.

### When to Use SSDT-DMAC
- Use SSDT-DMAC if:
  - `AppleVTD` is absent from the IO Registry after completing the above steps.
  - Your motherboard’s ACPI tables lack a DMAC device (check using **MaciASL** or **acpidump**).
  - You’re experiencing issues with GPU passthrough, Thunderbolt/USB hotplug, or DMA-dependent networking devices.

### Steps to Implement SSDT-DMAC
1. **Obtain SSDT-DMAC**:
   - Download [SSDT-DMAC.aml](/Content/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/DMA_Controller_(SSDT-DMAC)) file.
2. **Add to OpenCore**:
   - Place SSDT-DMAC in your OpenCore `ACPI` folder.
   - Add it to `config.plist` under `ACPI > Add`.
3. **Reboot and Verify**:
   - Boot into macOS.
   - Check **IORegistryExplorer** for `AppleVTD` and confirm DMAC presence under `_SB.PCI0.LPCB`.
   - Test AppleVTD-dependent features (e.g., GPU passthrough or Thunderbolt).

## Troubleshooting
- **AppleVTD Still Not Present**:
  - Verify VT-d is enabled in BIOS.
  - Ensure the modified DMAR table is correctly injected.
  - Check macOS logs (`Console.app` or `dmesg`) for AppleVTD-related errors.
  - Confirm SSDT-DMAC is loaded (use **MaciASL** to inspect ACPI tables).
- **Hardware Compatibility**:
  - If AppleVTD remains unavailable, your CPU or chipset may not support VT-d. Verify using Intel’s processor specification or your motherboard’s documentation.
- **Networking Issues**:
  - If NICs or WiFi cards (e.g., Intel I225-V, Fenvi, Aquantia) fail, ensure AppleVTD is active and test with/without SSDT-DMAC.

## Notes
- **Redundancy**: If your motherboard’s ACPI tables already define a DMAC device, SSDT-DMAC is unnecessary.
- **Safety**: SSDT-DMAC is safe to use, as it only modifies ACPI tables for macOS and is ignored by other operating systems.
- **OpenCore Resources**: Refer to the [OC-Little-Translated GitHub](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated) for additional ACPI and AppleVTD guidance.

By following this guide, you should be able to enable AppleVTD for GPU passthrough, Thunderbolt/USB hotplug, or advanced networking in your Hackintosh setup.
