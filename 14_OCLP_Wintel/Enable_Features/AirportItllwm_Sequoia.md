# Using `AirportItlwm.kext` in macOS Sequoia 

## About

As you may know, Apple removed support for various system kexts and frameworks required by Broadcom WiFi cards from macOS Sequoia. Although Apple never shipped any systems with Intel WiFi/BT cards, `AirportItlwm.kext` also required these system kexts and frameworks to function properly. So in macOS Sequoia, users with Intel WiFi/BT cards had to resort to a the `Itlwm.kext` instead. 

Since `Itlwm.kext` injects the WiFi card as LAN adapter into macOS, this has some side-effects. For example, the Airport-Utility which lets you connect to WiFi hotspot can no longer be used â€“ a separate app (`Heliport`) has to be used to join WiFi APs. Another issue is that FindMyMac also requires WiFi.

Luckily for use, we can utilize OpenCore Legacy patcher to make use of `AirportItlwm` in Sequoia again!

## Patching principle

1. Inject the Intel WiFi card as a legacy 4360 Broadcom card via `DeviceProperties` &rarr; This will allow "Modern WiFi" patches in OCLP 
2. Inject the required kexts for re-enabling the legacy WiFi cards
3. Apply root patches
4. Disable the WiFi spoof again
5. Reboot to macOS Sequoia, voila, `AirportItlwm.kext` working in Sequoia 

## Instructions

We need to prepare the `config.plist` and EFI folder content to make `AirportItlwm.kext` work again!

### 1. Spoof Intel WiFi as a Broadcom card

- In your `config.plist`, create an entry for a Broadcom BCM4360 device in `DeviceProperties`:
	```xml
	<key>DeviceProperties</key>
	<dict>
		<key>Add</key>
		<dict>
			<key>PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x1)/Pci(0x0,0x0)</key>
			<dict>
				<key>IOName</key>
				<string>pci14e4,43a0</string>
				<key>compatible</key>
				<string>pci106b,117</string>
				<key>device-id</key>
				<data>oEMAAA==</data>
				<key>device_type</key>
				<string>Network controller</string>
				<key>model</key>
				<string>BCM4360 802.11 ac Wireless Network Adapter</string>
				<key>name</key>
				<string>pci14e4,43a0</string>
				<key>pci-aspm-default</key>
				<integer>0</integer>
				<key>subsystem-id</key>
				<data>FwEAAA==</data>
				<key>subsystem-vendor-id</key>
				<data>axAAAA==</data>
				<key>vendor-id</key>
				<data>5BQAAA==</data>
			</dict>
	```
- Get the correct PCI device path for *your* Intel WiFi card. 
- You can do this with Hackintool. Just find the entry for the Wireless Network Controler, right-click and select "Copy Device Path":<br>![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof01.png)
- Adjust the PCI path to match *your* system:<br>![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof02.png)
	
## 2. Block new `IOSkywalk` kext

Under `Kernel/Block`, add the following rule:

```xml
<dict>
	<key>Arch</key>
	<string>x86_64</string>
	<key>Comment</key>
	<string>Allow IOSkywalk Downgrade</string>
	<key>Enabled</key>
	<true/>
	<key>Identifier</key>
	<string>com.apple.iokit.IOSkywalkFamily</string>
	<key>MaxKernel</key>
	<string></string>
	<key>MinKernel</key>
	<string>24.0.0</string>
	<key>Strategy</key>
	<string>Exclude</string>
</dict>
```

## 3. Add Kexts
- Disable `Itlwm.kext`, if present!
- Add the following [**Kexts from the OCLP repo**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Wifi) to `EFI/OC/Kexts` and your `config.plist`:
	- `AMFIPasss.kext` 
	- `IOSkywalk.kext`
	- `IO8021FamilyLegacy.kext` (contains an additional kext as plugin)
	- [**`AirportItlwm.kext`**](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) (inject the one for macOS Ventura! I have renamed it to `AirportItlwm_Sequoia.kext` since I also have macOS Sonoma installed and it requires a different variant of the kext. Make sure, it is injected ***after*** `IOSkywalk` and `IO8021FamilyLegacy` kexts!
- Adjust MinKernel and MaxKernel Settings as shown in the **Screenshot**: <br>![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof03.png)

## 4. Disable `SecureBootModel`

Under `Misc`, change `SecureBootModel` to `Disabled`

## 5. NVRAM Entries (optional)
- Change `csr-active-config` to `08030000`
- Enable `-lilubetaall` boot.arg if WiFi/BT is not working in macOS Sequoia
- If Bluetooth stops working after root patching, add the following entries to the NVRAM section:

```xml
<key>7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82</key>
<dict>
	<key>bluetoothExternalDongleFailed</key>
	<data>AA==</data>
	<key>bluetoothInternalControllerInfo</key>
	<data>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=</data>
	<key>boot-args</key>
	<string>-lilubetaall</string>
	<key>csr-active-config</key>
	<data>AwgAAA==</data>
</dict>
```

- Save your `config.plist`

## 6. Download OCLP
- Since you won't have internet Access in macOS Sequoia, [download the latest release of OCLP](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) before rebooting into macOS
- Now reboot into macOS Sequoia

## 7. Apply root patches with OCLP

- Run OCLP
- Click on "Apply Root Patch" button
- "Networking: Modern WiFi" should be available:<br>![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof05.png)
- Click "Start Root Patching"
- It will install the necessary Frameworks required for `AirportItlwm` to work:<br> ![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof06.png)	

## 8. Disable spoofed Broadcom card

- Once root patching is completed successfully, disable the `DeviceProperty` for the fake `Bcm 4360` card by putting a `#` in front of it!

## 9. Reboot and enjoy!

- Reboot the system
- Perform an NVRAM reset
- Boot into macOS Sequoia
- You should now be able to use the Airport-Utility in macOS Sequoia again, to connect to WiFi APs (proof):<br> ![](/Users/5t33y0/Desktop/intel_spoof07.png)
