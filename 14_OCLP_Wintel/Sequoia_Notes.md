## Features unavailable on Intel Systems

- Basically everything "AI", incuding:
	- Apple Intelligence

## Observations
Listed below are things I noticed that are currently not workingâ€¦

- Most kexts require `-lilubetaall` to load
- Intel Bluetooth (WiFi works using `Itlwm.kext`!)

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Don't upgrade to macOS Sequoia on legacy systems that require root patches! There is not ETA for OpenCore Legacy Patcher with macOS 15 support available yet.

## OCLP Update Status

	- OCLP now has a .pkg installer which is the new recommended method for installing OpenCore Legacy Patcher (on real Macs)
	- New Privileged Helper Tool which removes requirement of password prompts for installing patches, creating installers, etc.
