## About
Although installing macOS Ventura on systems with Intel CPUs of the Ivy Bridge family can be achieved with OpenCore and the OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP), it's not officially supported nor documented by Dortania – the only provide support for legacy Macs by Apple. So there is no official guide on how to do it. I developed this guide based on my experiences trying to get macOS 13 running on my Lenovo T530 Laptop but it is applicable to desktop systems as well since I factored in the necessary changes for those, too.

### How Ivy Bridge systems are affected
In macOS Ventura, support for CPU families prior to Kaby Lake was dropped. For Ivy Bridge systems this affects CPU Instructions (missing AVX 2.0 instructions), CPU Power Management (removed `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin`), integrated Graphics and Metal support. So what we will do is prepare the config with the required patches, settings and kexts for installing and running macOS Ventura and then add iGPU/GPU drivers in Post-Install using OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

> **Note**: Check out the [list of things that were removed macOS Ventura](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/998) and the impact this has on pre-Kaby Lake systems. But keep in mind that this was written for real Macs so certain issues don't affect Wintel machines.

**This guide allows you to**: 

- Install or upgrade to macOS Ventura
- Re-Install iGPU/GPU drivers in Post-Install so hardware graphics acceleration is working
- Re-enable SMC CPU Power Management so you have proper CPU Power Management using `SSDT-PM`
- Use a native SMBIOS for Ivy Bridge CPUs for optimal performance (no more spoofing required)
- Install OTA updates [which wouldn't be possible otherwise](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/S_System_Updates#fixing-issues-with-system-update-notifications-in-macos-113-and-newer)

> **Warning**
This guide is not for beginners! There are a lot of things to consider when trying to get newer versions of macOS working on unsupported hardware. DON'T upgrade from an existing working version of macOS. You won't be able to downgrade afterwards if something goes wrong. Perform a clean install on a spare internal disk or create a new volume on your current one. 

## Precautions and Limitations
This is what you need to know before attempting to install macOS Monterey and newer on unsupported systems:

-  ⚠️ **Backup** your working EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB Flash Drive just in case something goes wrong because we have to modify the config and content of the EFI folder.
- **iGPU/GPU**: 
	- Check if your iGPU/GPU is supported by OCLP. Although Drivers for Intel, NVIDIA and AMD cards can be added in Post-Install, the [list is limited](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/PATCHEXPLAIN.html#on-disk-patches)
	- AMD Navi Cards (Radeon 5xxx and 6xxx) can't be used with Sandy Beidge and Ivy Bridge CPUs since they require the AVX 2.0 instruction set which is only available on Haswell and newer.
- **Networking**:
	- When using Broadcom Wifi/BT Cards, you will need a different [set of kexts](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-7-broadcom-wifi-and-bluetooth) to load which need to be controlled via `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` settings. On macOS 12.4 and newer, a new address check has been introduced in `bluetoothd`, which will trigger an error if two Bluetooth devices have the same address. This can be circumvented by adding boot-arg `-btlfxallowanyaddr` (provided by [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) kext).
	- Same applies to [Intel WiFi/BT](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-8-intel-wifi-and-bluetooth) cards using [OpenIntelWirless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) kexts
- **Security**: Modifying the system with OCLP Requires SIP, Apple Secure Boot and AMFI to be disabled so there are some compromises in terms of security.
- **System Updates**: 
	- Incremental (or delta) updates won't be available after applying root patches with OCLP. Instead, the whole macOS Installer will be downloaded every time (approx. 12 GB)!
	- ⚠️ Don't install **Security Response Updates** (RSR) introduced in macOS 13! They will fail to install on pre-Haswell systems. More info [**here**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1019).
- **Other**: Check out the [list of things that were removed macOS Ventura](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/998) and the impact this has on pre-Kaby Lake systems. But keep in mind that this was written for real Macs so certain issues don't apply to Wintel systems.

## Preparations
I assume you already have a working OpenCore configuration for your Ivy Bridge system. Otherwise follow Dortania's [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html) to create one. The instructions below are only additional steps required to install and boot macOS Monterey and newer.

### Update OpenCore and kexts
Update OpenCore to 0.9.2 or newer (mandatory). Because prior to 0.9.2, the `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` Quirk is [skipped when macOS Ventura is running](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/commit/77d02b36fa70c65c40ca2c3c2d81001cc216dc7c) so the kexts required for re-enabling SMC CPU Power Management can't be patched and the system won't boot unless you have a (modded) BIOS where CFG Lock can be disabled. Update your kexts to the latest versions as well to avoid compatibility issues.

To check which version of OpenCore you're currently using, run the following commands in Terminal:

```shell
nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:opencore-version
```

### Config Edits
Listed below, you find the required modifications to prepare your config.plist and EFI folder for installing macOS Monterey or newer on Ivy Bridge systems. If this is over your head, there's an [accompanying plist](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/plist/Ivy_Bridge_OCLP_Wintel_Patches.plist) that contains the necessary settings that you can use for cross-referencing.

Requires Polaris or Vega cards to work properly (Navi is not supported by OCLP). Combine with `unfairgva=x` bitmask (x= 1 to 7) to [address DRM issues](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/H_Boot-args#unfairgva-overrides)
`UEFI/Drivers` and <br> `EFI/OC/Drivers`| <ul> <li> Add `ResetNvramEntry.efi` to `EFI/OC/Drivers` <li> And to your config:<br> ![resetnvram](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/8d955605-fb27-401f-abdd-2c616b233418) | Adds a boot menu entry to perform an NVRAM reset but without resetting the order of the boot drives. Requires a BIOS with UEFI support.

## Testing the changes
Once you've added the required kexts and made the necessary changes to your config.plist, save, reboot and perform an NVRAM Reset. If your system still boots fine after that, you can now prepare the system for installing macOS 13.

### Adjusting the SMBIOS
If your system reboots successfully, we need to edit the config one more time and adjust the SMBIOS depending on the macOS Version *currently* installed.

#### When Upgrading from macOS Big Sur 11.3+
When upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer, we can use macOSes virtualization capabilities to trick it into thinking that it is running in a VM so spoofing a compatible SMBIOS is no longer a requirement.

Based on your system, use one of the following SMBIOSes for Ivy Bridge CPUs. Open your config.plist and change the `SystemProductName` in the `PlatformInfo/Generic` section. The processor numbers mentioned in brackets are CPUs used in actual Mac machines. 

- **For Desktops**: 
	- **`iMac13,1`** (i5-3330S, i5-3470S, i7-3770S)
	- **`iMac13,2`** (i5-3470S, i5-3470, i7-3770)
	- **`iMac13,3`** (i3-3225)
	- **`MacPro6,1`** (E5-1620v2, E5-1650v2, E5-1680v2, E5-2697v2)
- **For Laptops**:
	- **`MacBookPro10,1`** (i7-3615QM, i7-3635QM, i7-3720QM, i7-3740QM, i7-3820QM, i7-3840QM)
	- **`MacBookPro10,2`** (i5-3210M, i7-3520M, i5-3230M, i7-3540M)
	- **`MacBookPro9,1`** (i7-3615QM, i7-3720QM, i7-3820QM)
	- **`MacBookPro9,2`** (I5-3210M, I7-3520M)
	- **`MacBookAir5,1`** (i5-3317U, i7-3667U)
	- **`MacBookAir5,2`** (i5-3317U, i5-3427U or i7-3667U)
- **For NUCs**:
	- **`Macmini6,1`** (i5-3210M)
	- **`Macmini6,2`** (i7-3615QM, i7-3720QM)
- Generate new Serials using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)

> **Note**: Once macOS 12 or newer is installed, you can disable the "Reroute kern.hv" and "IOGetVMMPresent" Kernel Patches. RestrictEvents will handle the VMM-Board-id spoof. **Only Exception**: Before running the "Install macOS" App, you have to re-enable the kernel patches again. Otherwise the installer will say the system is incompatible because of the unsupported SMBIOS it detects.
 	
#### When Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
Since macOS Catalina and older lack the virtualization capabilities required to apply the VMM Board-ID spoof, switching to a supported SMBIOS temporarily is mandatory in order to be able to install macOS Ventura. Otherwise you will be greeted by the crossed-out circle instead of the Apple logo when trying to boot.

**Supported SMBIOSes**

- **Desktop**: 
	- **`iMac18,1`** or newer
	- **`MacPro7,1`** (High End Desktops)
- **Laptop**: 
	- **`MacBookPro14,1`** or 
	- **`MacBookAir8,1`**
- **NUC**: 
	- **`Macmini8,1`**

Generate new Serials using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)

> **Note**: <ul><li> Once macOS 12 or newer is installed, you can switch to an SMBIOS best suited for your Ivy Bridge CPU and reboot to enjoy all the benefits of a proper SMBIOS. <li> You may want to generate a new [**SSDT-PM**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/CPU_Power_Management/CPU_Power_Management_(Legacy)) in Post-Install to optimize CPU Power Management. <li> You can also disable the "Reroute kern.hv" and "IOGetVMMPresent" Kernel Patches. RestrictEvents will handle the VMM-Board-id spoof from now on. **Only Exception**: Before running the "Install macOS" App, you have to re-enable the kernel patches again. Otherwise the installer will say the system is incompatible because of the unsupported SMBIOS it detects. 

## macOS Ventura Installation
With all the prep work out of the way, you can now upgrade to macOS Ventura. Depending on the version of macOS you are coming from, the installation process differs.

### Getting macOS
- Download the latest release of [OpenCore Patcher GUI App](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) and run it
- Click on "Create macOS Installer"
- Click on "Download macOS Installer"
- Select macOS 13.x (whatever the latest available build is)  
- Once the download is completed the "Install macOS Ventura" app will be located in your "Programs" folder

> **Note**: OCLP can also create a USB Installer if you want to perform a clean install (highly recommended)

### Option 1: Upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer 
Only applicable when upgrading from macOS 11.3+. If you are on macOS Catalina or older, use Option 2 instead.

- Run the "Install macOS Ventura" App
- There will be a few reboots
- Boot from the new macOS Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker

Once the installation has finished and the system boots it will run without graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if you GPU is not supported by macOS. We will address this in Post-Install.

### Option 2: Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
When upgrading from macOS Catalina or older a clean install from USB flash drive is recommended. To create a USB Installer, you can use OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

- Run Disk utility
- Create a new APFS Volume on your internal SSD or use a separate internal disk (at least 60 GB in size) for installing macOS 13. DON'T install it on an external drive – it won't boot!
- Attach an empty USB flash drive for creating the installer (16 GB+)
- Run OCLP and follow the [**instructions**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html#creating-the-installer)
- Once the USB Installer has been created, do the following:
	- Copy the OpenCore-Patcher App to the USB Installer
	- Add additional tools (optional, in case internet is not working): 
		- Add Python Installer
		- Add MountEFI
		- Add ProperTree
- Reboot 
- Select "Install macOS Ventura" from the BootPicker
- Install macOS Ventura on the volume you prepared earlier 
- There will be a few reboots during installation. Boot from the new "Install macOS" Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker
- Once the macOS Ventura installation is finished, switch back to an SMBIOS best suited for your Ivy Bridge CPU mentioned earlier.

After the installation is completed and the system boots it will run without hardware graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if you GPU is no longer supported by macOS. We will address this in Post-Install. 

## Post-Install
OpenCore Legacy patcher can re-install components which were removed from macOS, such as Graphics Drivers, Frameworks, etc. This is called "root patching". For Wintel systems, we will make use of it to install iGPU and GPU drivers primarily.

### Installing Intel HD4000 Drivers
Once you reach the set-up assistant (where you select your language, time zone, etc), you will notice that the system feels super sluggish – that's normal because it is running in VESA mode without graphics acceleration, since the friendly guys at Apple removed the Intel HD 4000 drivers. 

To bring them back, do the following:

- Run the OpenCore Patcher App 
- In the OpenCore Legacy Patcher menu, select "Post Install Root Patch":</br>![Post_Root_Patches](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/15fe5dc1-793c-465c-9252-1ee6e503c680)
- Next, click on "Start Root Patching":</br>![startpatch](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/a3e96078-6a66-4db4-99a5-5edf31c9fc8f)
- The App has to relaunch with Admin Roots. Click Yes:</br>![reeeelaunch](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/25df894b-f943-4720-83ab-04c35c685043)
- You will have to enter your Admin Password and then the installation will begin:</br>![Install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181920398-38ddf7c5-0dfd-428e-9d7a-5646010d3c08.png)
- Once. it's done, you have to reboot and Graphics acceleration will work
- Continue with the Post-Install process as described in the Repo.

### Installing Drivers for other GPUs
- Works basically the same way as installing iGPU drivers
- OCLP detects the GPU and if it has drivers for it, they can be installed. Afterwards, GPU Hardware Acceleration should work. Note that additional settings in OCLP may be required based on the GPU you are using.
- After the drivers have been installed, disable the following `boot-args` prior to rebooting to re-enable GPU graphics acceleration:
  - `-radvesa` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#-radvesa`
  - `nv_disable=1` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#nv_disable=1`

> **Note**: Prior to installing macOS updates you probably have to re-enable boot-args for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs again to put them into VESA mode so you have a picture and not a black screen!

### Verifying SMC CPU Power Management
To verify that SMC CPU Power Management is working, enter the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sysctl machdep.xcpm.mode
```
If the output is `0`, the legacy `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` is used for CPU Power Management and everything is ok. If the output is `1`, the `X86PlatformPlugin` for `XCPM` is used, which is not good since XCPM doesn't work well on Ivy Bridge CPUs in macOS. In this case, check if the necessary kexts for SMC CPU Power Management were injected by OpenCore. Enter in Terminal:

```shell
kextstat | grep com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement
```
This should result in the following output:

```
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement (222.0.0)
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagementClient (222.0.0) 
```
If the 2 kexts are not present, they were not injected. So check your config and EFI folder again. Also ensure that the `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` Quirk is enabled.

#### Optimizing CPU Power Management
Once you've verified that SMC CPU Power Management (plugin-type `0`) is working, monitor the behavior of the CPU using Intel Power Gadget. If it doesn't reach its maximum turbo frequency or if the base frequency is too high/low or if the idle frequency is too high, [generate an `SSDT-PM`](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/CPU_Power_Management/CPU_Power_Management_(Legacy)#readme) to optimize CPU Power Management.

### Removing/Disabling boot-args
After macOS Ventura is installed and OCLP's root patches have been applied in Post-Install, remove or disable the following boot-args:

- `ipc_control_port_options=0`: ONLY when using a dedicated GPU. You still need it when using the Intel HD 4000 so Firefox and electron-based apps will work.
- `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1`: ONLY needed for re-applying root patches with OCLP after System Updates
- Change `-radvesa` to `#-radvesa` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs.
- Change `nv_disable=1` to `#nv_disable=1` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs.

> **Note**: Keep a backup of your currently working EFI folder on a FAT32 USB flash drive just in case your system won't boot after removing/disabling these boot-args!

### Verifying AMFI is enabled
We can check whether or not AMFI is enabled by entering the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sudo /usr/sbin/nvram -p | /usr/bin/grep -c "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
```

- The desired output is `0`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is not present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is enabled. This is good.
- If the output is `1`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is disabled. 

Since the new `AMFIPass.kext` allows booting macOS with applied root patches and SIP as well as SecureBootModel disabled but AMFI enabled, we want the output to be `0`!

## OCLP and System Updates
The major advantage of using OCLP over the previously used Chris1111s HD4000 Patcher is that it remains on the system even after installing System Updates. After an update, it detects that the graphics drivers are missing and asks you, if you want to to patch them in again:</br>![Notify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181934588-82703d56-1ffc-471c-ba26-e3f59bb8dec6.png)

You just click on "Okay" and the drivers will be re-installed. After the obligatory reboot, everything will be back to normal.

## Notes
- Installing drivers on the system partition breaks its security seal. This affects System Updates: every time a System Update is available, the FULL Installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded.
- After each System Update, the iGPU/GPU drivers have to be re-installed. OCLP will take care of this. Just make sure to re-enable the appropriate boot-args to put AMD/NVIDIA GPUs in VESA mode prior to updating/upgrading macOS.
- ⚠️ You cannot install macOS Security Response Updates (RSR) on pre-Haswell systems. They will fail to install (more info [**here**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1019)).
