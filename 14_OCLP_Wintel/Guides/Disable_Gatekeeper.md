# How to disable Gatekeeper in macOS Sequoia

## Preface

After installing macOS Sequoia beta 3 on a new Volume, I wanted to run Corpnewt's MountEFI script to mount the ESP but it was blocked by Gatekeeper. Right-clicking the file and selecting "Open" does no longer work, which is new. So I decided to disable GateKeeper via Terminal, only to realize that this is no longer possible either:

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
Password:
This operation is no longer supported. To disable the assessment subsystem, please use configuration profiles.
```

So, config profiles it isâ€¦

## Instructions

1. Download the ["Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip"](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/files/Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip) and unzip it
2. Go to System Settings >> General >> Device Management and click the <kbd>+</kbd> button
3. Navigate to the Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file and open it
4. A new device called "Disable Gatekeeper" should appear:<br>![disablegk](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b76ed1c1-77d5-47d7-97f5-622ccf724451)

Afterwards, Gatekeeper will be disabled.
