# How to disable Gatekeeper in macOS Sequoia

## Preface

After installing macOS Sequoia beta 3 on a new Volume, I wanted to run Corpnewt's MountEFI script to mount the ESP but it was blocked by Gatekeeper. Right-clicking the file and selecting "Open" does no longer work, which is new. So I decided to disable GateKeeper via Terminal, only to realize that this is no longer possible either:

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
Password:
This operation is no longer supported. To disable the assessment subsystem, please use configuration profiles.
```

So, config profiles it isâ€¦

## Disabling Gatekeeper with  the Sentinel app (recommended)

This will install a signed config profile to disable Gatekepper.

- Download the latest version of [**Sentinel**](https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel/releases)
- Unzip and run the app
- Click on the green lock icon
- Enter your admin password
- Click "Ok" in the "Attention" pop-up
- This will open the System Settings >> Privacy & Security
- Scroll down to security and select "Anywhere" from the dropdown menu:<br>![disableGK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ac2a51-1207-4f7e-b68a-4dbe11291d22)
- Enter your admin pw again
- Read the disclaimer about reduced security when disabling Geatekeeper and press the red text and go on with your life:<br>![blabla](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad9aa47c-d384-4da3-bd3a-4f8519e6cbef)

Afterwards Gatekeeper will be disabled

## Previous Method

This will also install a config profile to disable Gatekepper but it will be unsigned.

- Download [Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/files/Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip) and unzip it
- Go to System Settings >> General >> Device Management and click the <kbd>+</kbd> button
- Navigate to the Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file and open it
- A new device called "Disable Gatekeeper" should appear:<br>![disablegk](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b76ed1c1-77d5-47d7-97f5-622ccf724451)

Afterwards, Gatekeeper will be disabled.
