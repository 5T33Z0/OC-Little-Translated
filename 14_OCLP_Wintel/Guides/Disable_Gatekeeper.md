# How to disable Gatekeeper in macOS Sequoia

![macOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported_macOS:-≤15.3-white.svg)

## Disabling Gatekeeper in macOS ≥ 15.1.1

From macOS 15.1.1 onward, Apple reverted the necessity of having a configuration profile to disable Gatekeeper, so the old Terminal command works again:

``` shell
spctl --master-disable
Globally disabling the assessment system needs to be confirmed in System Settings.
```

- Next, navigate to "System Settings" >> "Privacy & Security"
- Scroll down to "Security" and select "Anywhere" from the dropdown menu.
- Read the note about reduced security when disabling Geatekeeper, press "Allow Anywhere" and go on with your life:<br>![allowanywhere](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d752aa-65a8-411a-b234-2746da424f55)

## Disabling Gatekeeper in macOS Sequoia < 15.1.1

After installing macOS Sequoia beta 3 on a new APFS volume, I wanted to run Corpnewt's MountEFI script to mount the ESP but it was blocked by Gatekeeper. Right-clicking the file and selecting "Open" did no longer work either. So I decided to disable GateKeeper via Terminal as usual, only to realize that this is no longer possible either:

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
Password:
This operation is no longer supported. To disable the assessment subsystem, please use configuration profiles.
```

So, config profiles it is… 

### Disabling Gatekeeper with the Sentinel app 

The Sentinal app will install a _signed_ config profile to disable Gatekepper.

- Download the latest version of [**Sentinel**](https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel/releases)
- Unzip and run the app
- Click on the green lock icon
- Enter your admin password
- Click "Okay" in the "Attention" pop-up:<br>![att](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c66a4c7-693f-4eab-9aa6-47ae5c1f5fe7)
- This will open the System Settings >> Privacy & Security
- Scroll down to "Security" and select "Anywhere" from the dropdown menu:<br>![disableGK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ac2a51-1207-4f7e-b68a-4dbe11291d22)
- Enter your admin pw once again
- Read the note about reduced security when disabling Geatekeeper, press "Allow Anywhere" and go on with your life:<br>![allowanywhere](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74d752aa-65a8-411a-b234-2746da424f55)

### Previous Method

This will also install a config profile to disable Gatekepper but it will be _unsigned_.

- Download [Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/files/Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig.zip) and unzip it
- Go to System Settings >> General >> Device Management and click the <kbd>+</kbd> button
- Navigate to the Disable.Gatekeeper.mobileconfig file and open it
- A new device called "Disable Gatekeeper" should appear:<br>![disablegk](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b76ed1c1-77d5-47d7-97f5-622ccf724451)

Afterwards, Gatekeeper will be disabled.
