## About
Besides installing macOS Ventura+ on unsupported platforms like Sandy/Ivy Bridge, Haswell/Broadwell and Skylake, it is also be possible to install it on 1st Gen Intel Core CPUs using OpenCore and the OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP).

| ⚠️ Important Status Updates |
|:----------------------------|
| All good.

### Disclaimer
This guide is intended to provide general information for adjusting your EFI and config.plist to install and run macOS Monterey and newer on unsupported Wintel systems. Since I only have an iMac11,3 that uses an i7-870 to check the kext and settings it uses, this guide must be considered experimental! I created it to lay out the basic principle of how one could go about attempting to install macOS 13+ on ancient harwdware – it's not a given that it'll work! So please refrain from using the "report issue" function to seek individualized assistance for fixing your config. Such issue reports will be closed immediately!

## CPU Requirements
In order to check if your system is potentially capable of installing and running macOS, you need to verify that your CPU fulfills the minimum CPU requirements, which are:

1. A **64-bit** Intel CPU modle which has been used in Apple Macs (so no Atoms, Celerons and Pentiums)
2. CPU must support **SSE4.2** in order to boot macOS 10.14 Mojave and newer

### Potential Candidates
1st Gen Intel Core CPUs. Check [this list](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/CPU_to_SMBIOS.md) to find out if your CPU is supported and which SMBOS is suitable.

### Patching Principle
In macOS Ventura and newer, support for CPU families prior to Kaby Lake was dropped. For Sandy Bridge and older this mainly affects:

- CPU instructions:
	- Missing AVX2.0 for cryptography tasks
	- Missing [rdrand instructions](https://github.com/reenigneorcim/SurPlus)
- CPU Power Management (removed `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin`) 
- iGPU, dGPU and Metal support
- USB 1.1 support
- Legacy Ethernet and Wi-Fi

So what we will do is prepare the config with the required patches, settings and kexts for installing and running macOS 13+ and then add back iGPU/GPU drivers (and whatever else is missing) in Post-Install using OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

## Precautions and Limitations
This is what you need to know before attempting to install macOS Monterey and newer on unsupported systems:

-  ⚠️ **Backup** your working EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB Flash Drive just in case something goes wrong because we have to modify the config and content of the EFI folder.
- **USB Support**: Ventura dropped USB 1.1 protocol completely and also deleted some USB port mappings. So you probably have to map it manually.
- **iGPU/GPU**: 
	- Check if your iGPU/GPU is supported by OCLP. Although Drivers for Intel, NVIDIA and AMD cards can be added in Post-Install, the [list is limited](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/PATCHEXPLAIN.html#on-disk-patches)
	- AMD Navi Cards (Radeon 5xxx and 6xxx) can't be used with pre-Haswell CPUs since they require the AVX 2.0 instruction set which is only available on Haswell and newer.
- **Networking**:
	- For **Ethernet**, there are kexts for legacy LAN controllers [available here](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Ethernet)
	- **Wifi and Bluetooth**:
		- For enabling Broadcom Wifi/BT Cards, you will need a different [set of kexts](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-7-broadcom-wifi-and-bluetooth) to load which need to be controlled via `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` settings. On macOS 12.4 and newer, a new address check has been introduced in `bluetoothd`, which will trigger an error if two Bluetooth devices have the same address. This can be circumvented by adding boot-arg `-btlfxallowanyaddr` (provided by [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) kext).
		- Same applies to [Intel WiFi/BT](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-8a-intel-wifi-airportitlwm-and-bluetooth-intelbluetoothfirmware) cards using [OpenIntelWirless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) kexts
		- [Enabling Wifi in macOS Sonoma](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Enable_Features/WiFi_Sonoma.md) requires additional kext and also applying root patches in Post-Install!
- **Security**: Modifying the system with OCLP Requires SIP, Apple Secure Boot and AMFI to be disabled so there are some compromises in terms of security.
- **System Updates**: 
	- Incremental (or delta) updates won't be available after applying root patches with OCLP. Instead, the whole macOS Installer will be downloaded every time (approx. 12 GB)!
	- ⚠️ Don't install **Security Response Updates** (RSR) introduced in macOS 13! They will fail to install on pre-Haswell systems. More info [**here**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1019).
- **Other**: Check the links below for in-depth documentation about components/features that have been removed from macOS 12 and newer and the impact this has on systems prior to Kaby Lake. But keep in mind that this was written for real Macs so certain issues don't apply to Wintel systems.
	- [Status of OpenCore Legacy Patcher Support for macOS Sonoma](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1076)
	- [Status of OpenCore Legacy Patcher Support for macOS Ventura](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/998)
	- [Legacy Metal Support and macOS Ventura/Sonoma](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1008)

## Preparations
I assume you already have a working OpenCore configuration for your legacy system. Otherwise follow Dortania's [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/prerequisites.html) to create one. The instructions below are only *additional* steps required to be able to install and boot macOS Monterey and newer.

### Update OpenCore and kexts
Update OpenCore to 0.9.2 or newer (mandatory). Because prior to 0.9.2, [`AppleCpuPmCfgLock` Quirk is skipped when macOS Ventura is running](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/commit/77d02b36fa70c65c40ca2c3c2d81001cc216dc7c) so the kexts required for re-enabling SMC CPU Power Management can't be injected and the system won't boot unless you have a (modded) BIOS where CFG Lock can be disabled. To check which version of OpenCore you're currently using, run the following commands in Terminal:

```shell
nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:opencore-version
```

- Update your kexts to the latest version as well to avoid compatibility issues with macOS!
- If you're having issues during install deactivate non-essential kexts.

## Config Edits
Listed below, you find the required modifications to prepare your config.plist and EFI folder for installing macOS Monterey or newer.

:bulb: If your system (or components thereof) doesn't work afterwards, please refer to OCLP's [patch documentation](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/blob/main/docs/PATCHEXPLAIN.md) and see if need additional settings or kexts.

Required for applying Root Patches with OCLP ~~and booting macOS 12+~~. :bulb: No longer needed for booting thanks to AMFIPass.kext – only for installing Root Patches with OCLP. Disabling AMFI causes issues with [3rd party apps' access to Mics and Cameras](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/13_Peripherals/Fixing_Webcams.md).<li> **`ipc_control_port_options=0`**: Required for Intel HD 3000. Fixes issues with Firefox and electron-based apps like Discord.<li> **`-disable_sidecar_mac`**: For FeatureUnlock &rarr; Disables Sidecar/AirPlay/Universal Control patches because they are not supported by the hardware. <li> **`-radvesa`** (AMD only): Disables hardware acceleration and puts the card in VESA mode. Only required if your screen turns off after installing macOS 12+. Once you've installed the GPU drivers with OCLP, **disable it** so graphics acceleration works! <li> **`nv_disable=1`** (NVIDIA only): Disables hardware acceleration and puts the card in VESA mode. Only required if your screen turns off after installing macOS Ventura+. Kepler Cards switch into VESA mode automatically without it. Once you've installed the GPU drivers with OCLP, **disable it** so graphics acceleration works! <li>**`ngfxcompat=1`** (NVIDIA only): Ignores compatibility check in `NVDAStartupWeb`. Not required for Kepler GPUs <li>**`ngfxgl=1`** (NVIDIA only): Disables Metal Spport so OpenGL is used for rendering instead. Not required for Kepler GPUs. <li> **`nvda_drv_vrl=1`** (NVIDIA only): Enables Web Drivers. Not required for Kepler GPUs. <li> **`agdpmod=vit9696`** &rarr; Disables board-id check. Useful if screen turns black after booting macOS which can happen after installing NVIDIA Webdrivers. <li> **`-wegnoigpu`** &rarr; Optional. Disables the iGPU in macOS. **ONLY** required when using an AMD GPU and an SMBIOS for a CPU without on-board graphics (i.e. `iMacPro1,1` or `MacPro7,1`) to let the GPU handle background rendering and other tasks. Requires Polaris or Vega cards to work properly (Navi is not supported by OCLP). Combine with `unfairgva=x` bitmask (x= 1 to 7) to [address DRM issues](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/H_Boot-args#unfairgva-overrides). <li> **`-nokcmismatchpanic`** &rarr; Suppresses some potential Kernel Panics <li> **`vsmcgen=X`** &rarr; Force exposing X-gen SMC device (1 and 2 are supported).
**`EFI/OC/Drivers`**| Add the following Drivers to EFI/OC/Drivers and your config: <ul> <li> `ExFatDxeLegacy.efi` <li> `ResetNvramEntry.efi` and settings:<br> ![resetnvram](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/8d955605-fb27-401f-abdd-2c616b233418) | <ul><li> **ExFatDxeLegacy.efi**: Enables ExFat support on legacy systems <li> **ResetNvramEntry.efi**: Adds a boot menu entry to perform an NVRAM reset without resetting the order of the boot drives. Requires a UEFI BIOS.

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> Don't add the NVRAM parameter `OCLP-Version` to your config – it's meant for real Macs only! It checks if your `config.plist` is up to par with the one provided by OCLP. If the version in your config is lower, a pop-up will appear asking you if you would like to update OpenCore:
>
> ![oclp-version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3376afa3-da56-4311-9960-a9ec90e6010f)
>
> If you would press "OK" in this scenario, your `OC` folder would be replaced by the one created for the corresponding Mac model leaving your macOS installation in an unbootable state!

> [!TIP]
>
> To find clues about other Kexts, Settings and Boot-args that may be required for your legacy CPU, you can use OpenCore Legacy Patcher to generate an EFI folder and check it's contents and the config.plist:
>
> - Run the OpenCore Patcher App.
> - Under `Settings` select the `Target Model` that uses a CPU of the same family as yours (research on www.everymac.com to figure out which Mac uses your type of CPU) and press `Return`.
> - In the main window, the option "Build and Install OpenCore" will now be available. Click on it. This will buiöd the EFI folder and config for the selected Mac model.
> - DON'T install it! Instead, click on "View Build log". Copy the path listed at the end of the log.
> - In Finder, press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>, paste the addres and hit <kdd>Enter</kbd> to go to the temporary location that contains the "Build Folder" with the OpenCore EFI and config for the selected Mac model. Copy it to the desktop and check it for clues.

## Testing the changes
Once you've added the required kexts and made the necessary changes to your config.plist, save, reboot and perform an NVRAM Reset. Your system must boot successfully with the applied changes – otherwise don't continue! If it does still boot, you can now prepare your system for installing macOS 13.

### Adjusting the SMBIOS
If your system reboots successfully, we need to edit the config one more time and adjust the SMBIOS depending on the macOS Version *currently* installed.

#### When Upgrading from macOS Big Sur 11.3+
When upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer, we can use macOSes virtualization capabilities to trick it into "believing" that it is running in a VM so spoofing a compatible SMBIOS is no longer a requirement. So pick the SMBIOS best suited for your CPU family (&rarr; see "Potential Candidates" section or check [everymac.com](http://www.everymac.com)).

#### When Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
Since macOS Catalina and older lack the virtualization capabilities required to apply the VMM Board-ID spoof, switching to a supported SMBIOS temporarily is mandatory in order to be able to install macOS Ventura and newer. Otherwise you will be greeted by the crossed-out circle instead of the Apple logo when trying to boot.

**Supported SMBIOSes**:

- **Desktop**: 
	- **`iMac18,1`** or newer
	- **`MacPro7,1`** or **`iMacPro1,1`** (High End Desktops)
- **Laptop**: 
	- **`MacBookPro14,1`** or 
	- **`MacBookAir8,1`**
- **NUC**: 
	- **`Macmini8,1`** 
- Generate new Serials using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Once macOS 12 or newer is installed, you can switch to an SMBIOS designated for your CPU for optimal CPU Power Management. This is rather important since you cannot use ssdtPRGen on first Gen Intel Core and Xeon CPUs. 

## macOS installation
With all the prep work out of the way you can now upgrade to macOS Ventura or newer. Depending on the version of macOS you are coming from, the installation process differs.

### Getting macOS
- Download the latest release of [OpenCore Patcher GUI App](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) and run it
- Click on "Create macOS Installer"
- Click on "Download macOS Installer"
- Select the macOS version you want to install
- Once the download is completed the "Install macOS…" app will be located in your "Programs" folder

> [!NOTE]
> 
> OCLP can also create a USB installer if you want to perform a clean install (highly recommended). Creating a USB installer is a necessity if you want to install an older OS since macOS does not allow downgrading.

### Option 1: Upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer 
Only applicable when upgrading from macOS 11.3+. If you are on macOS Catalina or older, use Option 2 instead.

- Run the "Install macOS…" App
- There will be a few reboots
- Boot from the new "Install macOS…" partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker

Once the installation is completed and the system boots, it will run without graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if you GPU is not supported by the newer macOS version. We will address this in Post-Install.

### Option 2: Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
When upgrading from macOS Catalina or older a clean install from USB flash drive is recommended. To create a USB Installer, you can use OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

- Run Disk utility
- Create a new APFS Volume on your internal HDD/SSD or use a separate internal disk (at least 60 GB in size) for installing macOS 13 – DON'T install it on an external drive – it won't boot!
- Attach an empty USB flash drive for creating the installer (16 GB+)
- Run OCLP and follow the [**instructions**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html#creating-the-installer)
- Once the USB Installer has been created, do the following:
	- Copy the OpenCore-Patcher App to the USB Installer
	- Add Optional tools (Optional, in case internet is not working): 
		- Add Python Installer
		- Add MountEFI
		- Add ProperTree
- Reboot 
- Select "Install macOS Ventura" from the BootPicker
- Install macOS Ventura on the volume you prepared earlier 
- There will be a few reboots during installation. Boot from the new "Install macOS" Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker
- Once the macOS Ventura installation is finished, switch back to an SMBIOS best suited for your CPU as mentioned earlier.

After the installation is completed and the system boots it will run without hardware graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if you GPU is no longer supported by macOS. We will address this in Post-Install. 

## Post-Install
OpenCore Legacy patcher can re-install components which were removed from macOS, such as Graphics Drivers, Frameworks, etc. This is called "root patching". For Wintel systems, we will make use of it to install iGPU and GPU drivers primarily.

### Installing Drivers for other GPUs
- For Sandy Bridge and older, no iGPU drivers are available. You need a dedicated GPU supported by OCLP
- If your GPU is supported by OCLP, it detects it automatically and if it has drivers for it, they can be installed. Afterwards, GPU Hardware Acceleration should work. Note that additional settings in OCLP may be required based on the GPU you are using.
- After the drivers have been installed, disable the following `boot-args` prior to rebooting to re-enable GPU graphics acceleration:
  - `-radvesa` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#-radvesa`
  - `nv_disable=1` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#nv_disable=1`

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Prior to installing macOS updates you may have to re-enable boot-args for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs to put them into VESA mode so you have a picture and not a black screen!

### Verifying SMC CPU Power Management
To verify that SMC CPU Power Management is working, enter the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sysctl machdep.xcpm.mode
```
If the output is `0`, the legacy `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` is used for CPU Power Management and everything is ok. If the output is `1`, the `X86PlatformPlugin` for `XCPM` is active, which is not good since Sandy Bridge CPUs don't support XCPM. In this case, check if the necessary kexts for SMC CPU Power Management were injected by OpenCore. Enter in Terminal:

```shell
kextstat | grep com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement
```
This should result in the following output:

```
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement (222.0.0)
com.apple.driver.AppleIntelCPUPowerManagementClient (222.0.0) 
```
If the 2 kexts are not present, they were not injected. So check your config and EFI folder again. Also ensure that the `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` Quirk is enabled.

#### Optimizing CPU Power Management
Once you've verified that SMC CPU Power Management (plugin-type `0`) is working, monitor the behavior of the CPU using [Intel Power Gadget](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/1056-intel-power-gadget/). If it doesn't reach its maximum turbo frequency or if the base frequency is too high/low or if the idle frequency is too high, [generate an `SSDT-PM`](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/01_Adding_missing_Devices_and_enabling_Features/CPU_Power_Management/CPU_Power_Management_(Legacy)#readme) to optimize CPU Power Management.

### Removing/Disabling boot-args
After macOS Ventura is installed and OCLP's root patches have been applied in Post-Install, remove or disable the following boot-args:

- `ipc_control_port_options=0`: ONLY when using a dedicated GPU. You still need it when using the Intel HD 4000 so Firefox and electron-based apps will work.
- `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1`: ONLY needed for re-applying root patches with OCLP after System Updates
- Change `-radvesa` to `#-radvesa` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs.
- Change `nv_disable=1` to `#nv_disable=1` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Keep a backup of your currently working EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive just in case your system won't boot after removing/disabling these boot-args!

### Verifying AMFI is enabled
We can check whether or not AMFI is enabled by entering the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sudo /usr/sbin/nvram -p | /usr/bin/grep -c "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
```

- The desired output is `0`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is not present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is enabled. This is good.
- If the output is `1`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is disabled. 

Since the new `AMFIPass.kext` allows booting macOS with applied root patches and SIP as well as SecureBootModel disabled but AMFI enabled, we want the output to be `0`!

## OCLP and System Updates

### Re-applying root patches after System Updates
The major advantage of using OCLP over other Patchers is that it remains on the system even after installing System Updates. After an update, it detects that the graphics drivers are missing and asks you, if you want to to patch them in again, as shown in ths example:

![Notify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181934588-82703d56-1ffc-471c-ba26-e3f59bb8dec6.png)

You just click on "Okay" and the drivers will be re-installed. After the obligatory reboot, everything will be back to normal.

### OCLP App Update Notifications

OCLP can also inform you about availabled updates of the Patcher app itself. But this requires adding the key `OCLP-Version`to the `NVRAM/Add` section of your config.plist:

![OCLPver01](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/4a7b0fc8-2ab5-4d2c-9ab2-ea62ca7614ff)

This ke is optional for Hackintosh users, since the OCLP app also informs you about updates once you run it. If you choose to add it to your config, you also have to add a reset key to the corresponding `NVRAM/Delete` section, so that new values can be applied:

![OCLPver03](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/2ca84e3b-fb66-4d96-8fe8-d8ee94fde0a5)

After that, you will be notified whenever an update for the OpenCore Patcher is available:

![OCLPver02](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/dc61fb53-2a72-4523-81fe-a0df3596bc73)

Note that this Pop-up refers to "OpenCore" and not the Patcher because OCLP was designed with real Macs and Mac users in mind. For "regular" Mac users, using OCLP is most likely the only way they update OpenCore, config and kexts. So after downloading the latest OCLP update, they, just rebuild the EFI, mount the ESP, replaces the EFI/OC folder, apply reoo patches, reboot and that's it. 

But as Hackintosh users, we only care about the App updates to apply new, updated or refined root patches for iGPUs, Wi-FI, etc. Please keep in mind that you have to manually adjust the OCLP version number after each update so that you won't be notified about a possibly outdated patcher app although the newest version is installed already. So adding the OCLP-Version Key to a Hackintosh build is not really a necessity.

> [!TIP]
> 
> If your system won't boot after patching it with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, you have several options to [revert root patches](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/Reverting_Root_Patches.md).

## Notes
- Applying Root Patches to the system partition breaks its security seal. This affects System Updates: every time a System Update is available, the FULL Installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded. There is a [**workaround**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/S_System_Updates/OTA_Updates.md) to this but it's only applicable to Haswell/Broadwell and newer.
- After each System Update, the iGPU/GPU drivers have to be re-installed. OCLP will take care of this. Just make sure to re-enable the appropriate boot-args to put AMD/NVIDIA GPUs in VESA mode prior to updating/upgrading macOS.
- ⚠️ You cannot install macOS Security Response Updates (RSR) on pre-Haswell systems. They will fail to install (more info [**here**](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1019)).
