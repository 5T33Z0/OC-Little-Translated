# Using OCLP to find applicable settings and kexts to install macOS 12+ on unsupported Wintel systems

## Idea
The idea of this section is to analyze OpenCore EFI folders and configs generated by OCLP to figure out which settings and kexts can be utilized on legacy Wintels systems (aka Hackintoshes) to install macOS 12 or newer. Although I have created [config guides](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/14_OCLP_Wintel#configuration-guides) for 1st to 6th gen Intel Core CPUs that utilize settings and kexts from OCLP, there might be things I have missed since the only legacy systems I own are an Arrandale iMac, a Sandy Bridge iMac, and an IvyBridge notebook.  


## CPU Family to SMBIOS Conversion

Listed below are all the Intel-based Mac models (and SMBIOSes) supported by OpenCore Legacy Patcher grouped by CPU Family. Relevant here are 1st to 6th gen Intel CPUs â€“ 7th to 10th gen are still supported. This should make it easier to pick to research which settings, kexts and patches can be carried over to Wintel configs.

## Usage example
:warning: Backup your existing EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB flash drive before fiddling with OCLP! Please read the instructions carefully to avoid messing up your EFI/OC folder!

1. Check which Intel CPU you have and which CPU Family it belongs to
2. Find the corresponding SMBIOS best suited for your CPU and type of system (Dektop, Laptop, Mini-PC, HEDT) from the table above.
3. Run OCLP and click on "Settings"
4. From the "Target" dropdown menu, select the SMBIOS of your choice, then click "Return"
5. Back in the main window, select "Build and Install OpenCore"
6. This will generate the EFI for the selected Mac model in a temporary location
7. Once that's done, there will be a Pop-up:<br> ![EFI_build](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/71b8579b-924e-4697-addc-06bd88242e21)
8. :warning: **DON'T click on "Install to Disk"!** This will replace your EFI folder by the one for the corresponding Mac model whick will leave your system in an unbootable state
9. Instead, click on "View Build Log"
10. Copy the path to the EFI listed at the end of the log
11. Bring up Finder 
12. Press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>, paste the path and hit Enter
13. Copy the build folder to your desktop because it will be deleted once you quit OCLP
14. Check the EFI folder and config for settings and kexts missing from your config. Cross-reference with [the existing config guides](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/14_OCLP_Wintel#configuration-guides) I created and adjust your EFI and config.plist accordingly
15. Try installing/booting macOS Sonoma+ with your updated EFI and config.
