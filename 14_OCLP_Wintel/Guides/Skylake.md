## About
Although it is possible to utilize OpenCore and the OpenCore Legacy Patcher (OCLP) to install and run macOS Ventura and newer on machines with 6th Gen Intel Core CPUs (Skylake/Skylake X/W), it's not officially supported nor documented by Dortania – they only support legacy Macs by Apple. That's why I created this guide. Since I no longer own a Skylake system, there might be something I am missing.

| ⚠️ Important Status Updates |
|:----------------------------|
| All good.

### How Skylake systems are affected
With the release of macOS 13, Apple dropped support for all CPU families prior to Kaby Lake. For Skylake CPUs this mainly affects integrated Graphics and Metal support. So what we will do is prepare the config with the required patches, settings and kexts for installing and running macOS Ventura (or newer) and then add iGPU/GPU drivers in Post-Install using OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

### Disclaimer
This guide is intended to provide general information for adjusting your EFI and `config.plist` to install and run macOS Ventura or newer on unsupported Wintel systems. It is not a comprehensive configuration guide. Please refrain from using the "report issue" function to seek individualized assistance for fixing your config. Such issue reports will be closed immediately!

## Precautions and Limitations
This is what you need to know before attempting to install macOS 13 or newer on unsupported systems:

- :warning: **Backup** your working EFI folder on a FAT32 formatted USB Flash Drive just in case something goes wrong because we have to modify the config and content of the EFI folder.
- **iGPU/GPU**: Check if your iGPU/GPU is supported by OCLP. Although Drivers for Intel, NVIDIA and AMD cards can be added in Post-Install, the [list is limited](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/PATCHEXPLAIN.html#on-disk-patches) 
- Check if any peripherals you are using are compatible with macOS 12+ (Printers, WiFi and BlueTooth come to mind).
- **Networking**:
	- For **Ethernet**, there are kexts for legacy LAN controllers [available here](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Ethernet)
	- **Wifi and Bluetooth**:
		- For enabling Broadcom Wifi/BT Cards, you will need a different [set of kexts](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-7-broadcom-wifi-and-bluetooth) to load which need to be controlled via `MinKernel` and `MaxKernel` settings. On macOS 12.4 and newer, a new address check has been introduced in `bluetoothd`, which will trigger an error if two Bluetooth devices have the same address. This can be circumvented by adding boot-arg `-btlfxallowanyaddr` (provided by [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM) kext).
		- Same applies to [Intel WiFi/BT](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/10_Kexts_Loading_Sequence_Examples#example-8a-intel-wifi-airportitlwm-and-bluetooth-intelbluetoothfirmware) cards using [OpenIntelWirless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless) kexts
		- [Enabling Wifi in macOS Sonoma](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Enable_Features/WiFi_Sonoma.md) requires additional kext and also applying root patches in Post-Install!
- **Security**: Modifying the system with OCLP Requires SIP, Apple Secure Boot and AMFI to be disabled so there are some compromises in terms of security.
- **System Updates**: Incremental (or delta) updates won't be available after applying root patches with OCLP. Instead, the whole macOS Installer will be downloaded every time (approx. 15 GB for the latest OS), since root patching breaks the security seal of the volume! :bulb: In Haswell and newer, you can actually workaround this issue by reverting the root patches *prior* to checking for updates. Then, a regular incremental update will be installed which is much smaller. Afterwards you just have to re-apply the root patches again.
- **Other**: Check the links below for in-depth documentation about components/features that have been removed from macOS 12 and newer and the impact this has on systems prior to Kaby Lake. But keep in mind that this was written for real Macs so certain issues don't apply to Wintel systems.
	- [Status of OpenCore Legacy Patcher Support for macOS Sonoma](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1076)
	- [Status of OpenCore Legacy Patcher Support for macOS Ventura](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/998)
	- [Legacy Metal Support and macOS Ventura/Sonoma](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/1008)

## Preparations
I assume you already have a working OpenCore configuration for your Skylake system. Otherwise follow Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide ([**Desktop**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/skylake.html), [**Laptop/NUC**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/skylake.html), [**HEDT**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/skylake.html)) to create one. The instructions below only contain additional steps required to install and boot macOS Monterey and newer.

### Update OpenCore and kexts
Update OpenCore and kexts to the latest versions to maximize compatibility with macOS. To check which version of OpenCore you're currently using, run the following commands in Terminal:

```shell
nvram 4D1FDA02-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B30102:opencore-version
```

## Upgrade options
Since Skylake CPUs are relatively new, the only thing which doesn't really work out of the box is on-board grapics, specifically: Intel HD 530/P530/Iris which are only compatible up to macOS Monterey. There are 2 possible upgrade option for installing macOS Ventura or newer, depending on your hardware configuration:

### Option 1: Installing macOS 13+ without Root Patches
If you are using a PC and don't have to rely on the iGPU for driving a display and your GPU is compatible with macOS Ventura or newer, you only need to change the SMBIOS and add a Kaby Lake device-id to your iGPU framebuffer as explained here: [**Enabling Skylake Graphics in macOS 13**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/11_Graphics/iGPU/Skylake_Spoofing_macOS13). Once the iGPU spoof is working, jump to [**macOS Installation**](#macos-installation)

#### Pros and Cons of this method
- **Pros**:
	- Requires much less effort
	- Incremental system updates will still work afterwards
- **Cons**:
	- Requires Kaby Lake iGPU spoof, which is not 100% compatible
	- CPU Power Management is not optimal (can be addressed by implementing Board-ID VMM spoof and RestrictEvents kext)
	- macOS Sonoma requires SMBIOS `iMac19,1` (for Desktop PCs), so CPU Power Management won't be optimal. Use [**CPUFriendFriend**](https://github.com/corpnewt/CPUFriendFriend) to adjust it.

### Option 2: Installing macOS Ventura or newer with Root Patches
While an iGPU spoof works well for systems which use a dedicated GPU for displaying graphics, it's not working so well if the iGPU is required for driving a display becasue [these files were removed from macOS](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/blob/main/docs/PATCHEXPLAIN.md#extensions-5). So if you are using a Desktop/Laptop/NUC that relies on the iGPU because it has no dGPU or it is incompatible with macOS 12 or newer (e.g. NVIDIA Kepler Cards) then applying Root Patches in Post-Install with OCLP is the way to go.

#### Pros and Cons of this method

- **Pros**:
	- iGPU is working correctly
	- Legacy GPUs can be enabled (if OpenCore Legacy Patcher has drivers for it)
	- Ideal CPU/GPU Power Management because a native Skylake SMBIOS can be used
- **Cons**:
	- Takes more effort to configure
	- Incremental system updates won't work after applying root patches with OCLP. Instead, the full installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded each time a System Update is available.

### Config Edits
Listed below, you find the required modifications to prepare your config and EFI folder for installing macOS Monterey or newer on Skylake systems. I've also prepared a [.plist](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/plist/Skylake_OCLP_Wintel_Patches.plist) for cross-referencing which contains the necessary settings.

:bulb: If your system (or components thereof) doesn't work afterwards, please refer to OCLP's [patch documentation](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/blob/main/docs/PATCHEXPLAIN.md) and see if need additional settings or kexts.

Disables the iGPU in macOS. **ONLY** required when using an AMD GPU and an SMBIOS for a CPU without on-board graphics (i.e. `iMacPro1,1` or `MacPro7,1`) to let the GPU handle background rendering and other tasks. Requires Polaris or Vega cards to work properly (Navi is not supported by OCLP). Combine with `unfairgva=x` bitmask (x= 1 to 7) to [address DRM issues](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/H_Boot-args#unfairgva-overrides)
**`UEFI/Drivers`** and <br> **`EFI/OC/Drivers`**| <ul> <li> Add `ResetNvramEntry.efi` to `EFI/OC/Drivers` <li> And to your config:<br> ![resetnvram](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/8d955605-fb27-401f-abdd-2c616b233418) | Adds a boot menu entry to perform an NVRAM reset but without resetting the order of the boot drives. Requires a BIOS with UEFI support.
**`PlatformInfo/Generic`**| Adjust **SMBIOS**: <ul><li> **Desktop**: `iMac17,1` <li> **Laptop**: `MacBookPro13,1` <li> **NUC**: `iMac17,1` | Read **"Adjusting the SMBIOS"** for more details!

> [!CAUTION]
> 
> Don't add the NVRAM parameter `OCLP-Version` to your config – it's meant for real Macs only! It checks if your `config.plist` is up to par with the one provided by OCLP. If the version in your config is lower, a pop-up will appear asking you if you would like to update OpenCore:
>
> ![oclp-version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3376afa3-da56-4311-9960-a9ec90e6010f)
>
> If you would press "OK" in this scenario, your `OC` folder would be replaced by the one created for the corresponding Mac model leaving your macOS installation in an unbootable state!

## Testing the changes
Once you've added the required kexts and made the necessary changes to your config.plist, save, reboot and perform an NVRAM Reset. If your system still boots fine after that, you can now prepare the system for installing macOS 13.

### Adjusting the SMBIOS
If your system reboots successfully, we need to edit the config one more time and adjust the SMBIOS depending on the macOS Version *currently* installed.

#### When Upgrading from macOS Big Sur 11.3+
When upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer, we can use macOSes virtualization capabilities to trick it into thinking that it is running in a VM so spoofing a compatible SMBIOS is no longer a requirement.

Based on your system, use one of the following SMBIOSes for Skylake CPUs. Open your config.plist and change the SMBIOS in the `PlatformInfo/Generic` section.

- **For Desktops**: `iMac17,1`
- **For HEDT**: `iMacPro1,1`
- **For Laptops**:
	- `MacBookPro13,1` = 13″ Display, Core i5, iGPU: Iris 540
	- `MacBookPro13,2` = 13″ Display, Core i5, iGPU: Iris 550
	- `MacBookPro13,3` = 15″ Display, Core i7, iGPU: HD 530 + GPU: Radeon Pro 450/45
- **For NUC and USDTs**: `iMac17,1` (Apple never released a MacMini with Skylake CPUs)
- Generate new Serials using [**GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) or [**OCAT**](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools/releases)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Once macOS 12 or newer is installed, you can disable the "Reroute kern.hv" and "IOGetVMMPresent" Kernel Patches. RestrictEvents will handle the VMM-Board-id spoof from now on. **Only Exception**: Before running the "Install macOS" App, you have to re-enable the kernel patches again. Otherwise the installer will say the system is incompatible because of the unsupported SMBIOS it detects.

#### When Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
Since macOS Catalina and older lack the virtualization capabilities required to apply the VMM Board-ID spoof, switching to a supported SMBIOS temporarily is mandatory in order to be able to install macOS 13 or newer. Otherwise you will be greeted by the crossed-out circle instead of the Apple logo when trying to boot.

**Supported SMBIOSes**:

- **Desktop**:
	- **iMac18,1** or newer
	- **MacPro7,1** or **iMacPro1,1** (High End Desktops)
- **Laptop**:
	- **MacBookPro14,1** or
	- **MacBookAir8,1**
- **NUC**:
	- **Macmini8,1**
- Generate new Serials with [**GenSMBIOS**](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) or [**OCAT**](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools/releases)

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Once macOS is up and running, you can switch to an SMBIOS best suited for your Skylake CPU for optimal CPU Power Management.
> You can also disable the "Reroute kern.hv" and "IOGetVMMPresent" Kernel Patches. RestrictEvents will handle the VMM-Board-id spoof from now on. **Only Exception**: Before running the "Install macOS" App, you have to re-enable the kernel patches again. Otherwise the installer will say the system is incompatible because of the unsupported SMBIOS it detects.

## macOS installation
With all the prep work out of the way you can now upgrade to macOS Ventura or newer. Depending on the version of macOS you are coming from, the installation process differs.

### Getting macOS
- Download the latest release of [OpenCore Patcher GUI App](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/releases) and run it
- Click on "Create macOS Installer"
- Next, click on "Download macOS Installer"
- Select macOS 13.x (whatever the latest available build is)  
- Once the download is completed, the "Install macOS" app will be located in the "Programs" folder

> [!NOTE]
>
> OCLP can also create a USB Installer if you want to perform a clean install (highly recommended)

### Option 1: Upgrading from macOS 11.3 or newer
Only applicable when upgrading from macOS 11.3+. If you are on macOS Catalina or older, use Option 2 instead.

- Run the "Install macOS…" App
- There will be a few reboots
- Boot from the new macOS install entry until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker

Once the installation is complete and the system boots, it will run without graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if your GPU is not supported by the newer version of macOS. We will address this next in **Post-Install**.

> [!TIP]
> 
> Instead of upgrading your runnning macOS installation, create a new APFS volume and install macOS on there. This way you can always revert back to your previous macOS installation if you are facing issues with the new macOS version.

### Option 2: Upgrading from macOS Catalina or older
When upgrading from macOS Catalina or older a clean install from USB flash drive is recommended. To create a USB Installer, you can use OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

- Run Disk utility
- Create a new APFS Volume on your internal HDD/SSD or use a separate internal disk (at least 60 GB in size) for installing macOS 13 – DON'T install it on an external drive – it won't boot!
- Attach an empty USB flash drive for creating the installer (16 GB+)
- Run OCLP and follow the [**instructions**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/INSTALLER.html#creating-the-installer)
- Once the USB Installer has been created, do the following:
	- Copy the OpenCore-Patcher App to the USB Installer
	- Add Optional tools (Optional, in case internet is not working):
		- Add Python Installer
		- Add MountEFI
		- Add ProperTree
- Reboot
- Select "Install macOS" from the BootPicker
- Install macOS Ventura or newer on the volume you prepared earlier
- There will be a few reboots during installation. Boot from the new "Install macOS" Partition until it's no longer present in the Boot Picker
- Once the macOS installation is finished, switch back to an SMBIOS best suited for your Skylake CPU.

After the installation is completed and the system boots it will run without hardware graphics acceleration if you only have an iGPU or if you GPU is no longer supported by macOS. We will address this in Post-Install.

## Post-Install
OpenCore Legacy patcher can re-install components which were removed from macOS, such as Graphics Drivers, Frameworks, etc. This is called "root patching". For Wintel systems, we will make use of it to install iGPU and GPU drivers primarily.

### Installing Intel Skylake Graphics Acceleration Patches (macOS 13+)
Once you reach the set-up assistant (where you select your language, time zone, etc), you will notice that the system feels super sluggish – that's normal because it is running in VESA mode without graphics acceleration, since the friendly guys at Apple removed the Intel HD 2000/3000 drivers from macOS.

To bring them back, do the following:

- Run the OpenCore Patcher App
- In the OpenCore Legacy Patcher menu, select "Post Install Root Patch":</br>![Post_Root_Patches](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/15fe5dc1-793c-465c-9252-1ee6e503c680)
- Follow the instructions of the Patcher App (I don't have a Skylake CPU, so I can't capture screenshots. I also couldn't find any online.)

### Installing Drivers for other GPUs
- Works basically the same way as installing iGPU drivers
- OCLP detects the GPU and if it has drivers for it, they can be installed. Afterwards, GPU Hardware Acceleration should work. Note that additional settings in OCLP may be required based on the GPU you are using.
- After the drivers have been installed, disable the following `boot-args` prior to rebooting to re-enable GPU graphics acceleration:
  - `-radvesa` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#-radvesa`
  - `nv_disable=1` – put a `#` in front to disable it: `#nv_disable=1`

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to installing macOS updates you probably have to re-enable boot-args for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs again to put them into VESA mode so you have a picture and not a black screen!

### Removing/Disabling boot-args
After macOS is installed and OCLP's root patches have been applied in Post-Install, remove or disable the following boot-args:

- `ipc_control_port_options=0`: ONLY when using a dedicated GPU. You still need it when using the Intel HD 4000 so Firefox and electron-based apps will work.
- `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1`: ONLY needed for re-applying root patches with OCLP after System Updates
- Change `-radvesa` to `#-radvesa` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on AMD GPUs.
- Change `nv_disable=1` to `#nv_disable=1` &rarr; This disables the boot-arg which in return re-enables hardware acceleration on NVIDIA GPUs.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Keep a backup of your currently working EFI folder on a FAT32 USB flash drive just in case your system won't boot after removing/disabling these boot-args!

### Verifying AMFI is enabled
We can check whether or not AMFI is enabled by entering the following command in Terminal:

```shell
sudo /usr/sbin/nvram -p | /usr/bin/grep -c "amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1"
```

- The desired output is `0`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is not present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is enabled. This is good.
- If the output is `1`: this means, the `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1` boot-arg which disables AMFI is present in NVRAM which indicates that AMFI is disabled.

Since the new `AMFIPass.kext` allows booting macOS with applied root patches and SIP as well as SecureBootModel disabled but AMFI enabled, we want the output to be `0`!

## OCLP and System Updates

### Re-applying root patches after System Updates
The major advantage of using OCLP over other Patchers is that it remains on the system even after installing System Updates. After an update, it detects that the graphics drivers are missing and asks you, if you want to to patch them in again, as shown in ths example:

![Notify](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76865553/181934588-82703d56-1ffc-471c-ba26-e3f59bb8dec6.png)

You just click on "Okay" and the drivers will be re-installed. After the obligatory reboot, everything will be back to normal.

### OCLP App Update Notifications

OCLP can also inform you about availabled updates of the Patcher app itself. But this requires adding the key `OCLP-Version`to the `NVRAM/Add` section of your config.plist:

![OCLPver01](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/4a7b0fc8-2ab5-4d2c-9ab2-ea62ca7614ff)

This ke is optional for Hackintosh users, since the OCLP app also informs you about updates once you run it. If you choose to add it to your config, you also have to add a reset key to the corresponding `NVRAM/Delete` section, so that new values can be applied:

![OCLPver03](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/2ca84e3b-fb66-4d96-8fe8-d8ee94fde0a5)

After that, you will be notified whenever an update for the OpenCore Patcher is available:

![OCLPver02](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/assets/76865553/dc61fb53-2a72-4523-81fe-a0df3596bc73)

Note that this Pop-up refers to "OpenCore" and not the Patcher because OCLP was designed with real Macs and Mac users in mind. For "regular" Mac users, using OCLP is most likely the only way they update OpenCore, config and kexts. So after downloading the latest OCLP update, they, just rebuild the EFI, mount the ESP, replaces the EFI/OC folder, apply reoo patches, reboot and that's it. 

But as Hackintosh users, we only care about the App updates to apply new, updated or refined root patches for iGPUs, Wi-FI, etc. Please keep in mind that you have to manually adjust the OCLP version number after each update so that you won't be notified about a possibly outdated patcher app although the newest version is installed already. So adding the OCLP-Version Key to a Hackintosh build is not really a necessity.

## Notes
- Applying Root Patches to the system partition breaks its security seal. This affects System Updates: every time a System Update is available, the FULL Installer (about 12 GB) will be downloaded. But there is a [**workaround to reduce the size of OTA Updates**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/S_System_Updates/OTA_Updates.md).
- After each System Update, the iGPU/GPU drivers have to be re-installed. OCLP will take care of this. Just make sure to re-enable the appropriate boot-args to put AMD/NVIDIA GPUs in VESA mode prior to updating/upgrading macOS.
