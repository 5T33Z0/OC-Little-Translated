# Analyzing OpenCore builds generated by OCLP 

## About

This might be useful for Hackintosh users who want to update their OpenCore Config and EFI folder in order to install macOS Monterey and newer on otherwise unsupported or end-of-life Wintel systems. By default, using the [**configuration guides**](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/tree/main/14_OCLP_Wintel#configuration-guides) for 1st to 6th gen Intel Core systems is recommended. But if your are still having issues after applying the neccessary files and settings, having a look into the OpenCore folder of the corresponding Mac model (SMBIOS) might provide some clues.

**What does this do?**: Builds OpenCore EFI folder for selected SMBIOS without installing it to the ESP.

**Why?**: So you can analyze the contents of the EFI folder and config to find clues.

## Instructions
Run OpenCore Legacy Patcher and follow the instructions to build OpenCore folders for various SMBIOSes.

1. Open Settings: <br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-peqi.png)
2. Select an SMBIOS of your choice from the "Target Model" dropdown menu (in this example it's for a `MacBook10,1`):<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-pffn.png)
3. Click on "Return" to return to the main menu:<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-pfua.png)
4. Back in the main window, click on "Build and Install OpenCore"<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-phsn.png)
5. This will generate an OpenCore EFI folder with the required files and config.plist for the selected Mac Model. Once that's done, click on "View build log" â€“ **DON'T** click on "Install to disk": <br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-piid.png)
6. Select the the path at the bottom of the build log and copy it to the clipboard (CMD+C)![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-pizu.png)
7. Open Finder
8. Press CMD+G
9. Paste the path by pressing CMD+V and hit Enter
10. Grab the Open-Core Build folder and move it to a different location<br>![](/Users/5t33z0/Desktop/SCR-20250216-pliq.png)
11. Analyze the `EFI/OC` folder and `config.plist` for clues (kexts, settings, etc.) to apply them to your config.

> You must leave the OCLP app open while navigating to the location of the OC build, because the Build-Folder will be deleted automaticaly if the app is closed!
